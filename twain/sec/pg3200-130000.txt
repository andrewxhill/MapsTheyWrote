"Stand by you! indeed I will.  They sha'n't touch a hair of your head!"

she says, and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said

it, too.



"If I get away I sha'n't be here," I says, "to prove these rapscallions

ain't your uncles, and I couldn't do it if I WAS here.  I could swear

they was beats and bummers, that's all, though that's worth something.

Well, there's others can do that better than what I can, and they're

people that ain't going to be doubted as quick as I'd be.  I'll tell you

how to find them.  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper.  There--'Royal

Nonesuch, Bricksville.'  Put it away, and don't lose it.  When the court

wants to find out something about these two, let them send up to

Bricksville and say they've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch,

and ask for some witnesses--why, you'll have that entire town down here

before you can hardly wink, Miss Mary.  And they'll come a-biling, too."



I judged we had got everything fixed about right now.  So I says:



"Just let the auction go right along, and don't worry.  Nobody don't have

to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on

accounts of the short notice, and they ain't going out of this till they

get that money; and the way we've fixed it the sale ain't going to count,

and they ain't going to get no money.  It's just like the way it was with

the niggers--it warn't no sale, and the niggers will be back before

long.  Why, they can't collect the money for the NIGGERS yet--they're in

the worst kind of a fix, Miss Mary."



"Well," she says, "I'll run down to breakfast now, and then I'll start

straight for Mr. Lothrop's."



"'Deed, THAT ain't the ticket, Miss Mary Jane," I says, "by no manner of

means; go BEFORE breakfast."



"Why?"



"What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for, Miss Mary?"



"Well, I never thought--and come to think, I don't know.  What was it?"



"Why, it's because you ain't one of these leather-face people.  I don't

want no better book than what your face is.  A body can set down and read

it off like coarse print.  Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles

when they come to kiss you good-morning, and never--"



"There, there, don't!  Yes, I'll go before breakfast--I'll be glad to.

And leave my sisters with them?"



"Yes; never mind about them.  They've got to stand it yet a while.  They

might suspicion something if all of you was to go.  I don't want you to

see them, nor your sisters, nor nobody in this town; if a neighbor was to

ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something.  No,

you go right along, Miss Mary Jane, and I'll fix it with all of them.

I'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you've went

away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change, or to see a

friend, and you'll be back to-night or early in the morning."



"Gone to see a friend is all right, but I won't have my love given to

them."



"Well, then, it sha'n't be."  It was well enough to tell HER so--no harm

in it.  It was only a little thing to do, and no trouble; and it's the

little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below; it

would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.  Then I

says:  "There's one more thing--that bag of money."



"Well, they've got that; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW

they got it."



"No, you're out, there.  They hain't got it."



"Why, who's got it?"



"I wish I knowed, but I don't.  I HAD it, because I stole it from them;

and I stole it to give to you; and I know where I hid it, but I'm afraid

it ain't there no more.  I'm awful sorry, Miss Mary Jane, I'm just as

sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I come

nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I come

to, and run--and it warn't a good place."



"Oh, stop blaming yourself--it's too bad to do it, and I won't allow it

--you couldn't help it; it wasn't your fault.  Where did you hide it?"



I didn't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again; and I

couldn't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that

corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So

for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:



"I'd ruther not TELL you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't

mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and

you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to.  Do you

reckon that 'll do?"



"Oh, yes."



So I wrote:  "I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was

crying there, away in the night.  I was behind the door, and I was mighty

sorry for you, Miss Mary Jane."



It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by

herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own

roof, shaming her and robbing her; and when I folded it up and give it to

her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the

hand, hard, and says:



"GOOD-bye.  I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if I

don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of

you a many and a many a time, and I'll PRAY for you, too!"--and she was

gone.



Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more

nearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the same--she was just that

kind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion--there

warn't no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but

in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in my

opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it ain't

no flattery.  And when it comes to beauty--and goodness, too--she lays

over them all.  I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see her go

out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon I've

thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying she

would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good for me

to pray for HER, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.



Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see

her go.  When I struck Susan and the hare-lip, I says:



"What's the name of them people over on t'other side of the river that

you all goes to see sometimes?"



They says:



"There's several; but it's the Proctors, mainly."



"That's the name," I says; "I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she

told me to tell you she's gone over there in a dreadful hurry--one of

them's sick."



"Which one?"



"I don't know; leastways, I kinder forget; but I thinks it's--"



"Sakes alive, I hope it ain't HANNER?"



"I'm sorry to say it," I says, "but Hanner's the very one."



"My goodness, and she so well only last week!  Is she took bad?"



"It ain't no name for it.  They set up with her all night, Miss Mary Jane

said, and they don't think she'll last many hours."



"Only think of that, now!  What's the matter with her?"



I couldn't think of anything reasonable, right off that way, so I says:



"Mumps."



"Mumps your granny!  They don't set up with people that's got the mumps."



"They don't, don't they?  You better bet they do with THESE mumps.  These

mumps is different.  It's a new kind, Miss Mary Jane said."



"How's it a new kind?"



"Because it's mixed up with other things."



"What other things?"



"Well, measles, and whooping-cough, and erysiplas, and consumption, and

yaller janders, and brain-fever, and I don't know what all."



"My land!  And they call it the MUMPS?"



"That's what Miss Mary Jane said."



"Well, what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for?"



"Why, because it IS the mumps.  That's what it starts with."



"Well, ther' ain't no sense in it.  A body might stump his toe, and take

pison, and fall down the well, and break his neck, and bust his brains

out, and somebody come along and ask what killed him, and some numskull

up and say, 'Why, he stumped his TOE.'  Would ther' be any sense in that?

NO.  And ther' ain't no sense in THIS, nuther.  Is it ketching?"



"Is it KETCHING?  Why, how you talk.  Is a HARROW catching--in the dark?

If you don't hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another, ain't

you? And you can't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole

harrow along, can you?  Well, these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow,

as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to

get it hitched on good."



"Well, it's awful, I think," says the hare-lip.  "I'll go to Uncle Harvey

and--"



"Oh, yes," I says, "I WOULD.  Of COURSE I would.  I wouldn't lose no

time."



"Well, why wouldn't you?"



"Just look at it a minute, and maybe you can see.  Hain't your uncles

obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can?  And do you

reckon they'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that

journey by yourselves?  YOU know they'll wait for you.  So fur, so good.

Your uncle Harvey's a preacher, ain't he?  Very well, then; is a PREACHER

going to deceive a steamboat clerk? is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK?

--so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard?  Now YOU know he

ain't.  What WILL he do, then?  Why, he'll say, 'It's a great pity, but

my church matters has got to get along the best way they can; for my

niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps, and so it's

my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to

show on her if she's got it.'  But never mind, if you think it's best to

tell your uncle Harvey--"



"Shucks, and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good

times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane's

got it or not?  Why, you talk like a muggins."



"Well, anyway, maybe you'd better tell some of the neighbors."



"Listen at that, now.  You do beat all for natural stupidness.  Can't you

SEE that THEY'D go and tell?  Ther' ain't no way but just to not tell

anybody at ALL."



"Well, maybe you're right--yes, I judge you ARE right."



"But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she's gone out a while,

anyway, so he won't be uneasy about her?"



"Yes, Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that.  She says, 'Tell them to

give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss, and say I've run over

the river to see Mr.'--Mr.--what IS the name of that rich family your

uncle Peter used to think so much of?--I mean the one that--"



"Why, you must mean the Apthorps, ain't it?"



"Of course; bother them kind of names, a body can't ever seem to remember

them, half the time, somehow.  Yes, she said, say she has run over for to

ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house,

because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody

else; and she's going to stick to them till they say they'll come, and

then, if she ain't too tired, she's coming home; and if she is, she'll be

home in the morning anyway.  She said, don't say nothing about the

Proctors, but only about the Apthorps--which 'll be perfectly true,

because she is going there to speak about their buying the house; I know

it, because she told me so herself."



"All right," they said, and cleared out to lay for their uncles, and give

them the love and the kisses, and tell them the message.



Everything was all right now.  The girls wouldn't say nothing because

they wanted to go to England; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary

Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor

Robinson.  I felt very good; I judged I had done it pretty neat--I

reckoned Tom Sawyer couldn't a done it no neater himself.  Of course he

would a throwed more style into it, but I can't do that very handy, not

being brung up to it.



Well, they held the auction in the public square, along towards the end

of the afternoon, and it strung along, and strung along, and the old man

he was on hand and looking his level pisonest, up there longside of the

auctioneer, and chipping in a little Scripture now and then, or a little

goody-goody saying of some kind, and the duke he was around goo-gooing

for sympathy all he knowed how, and just spreading himself generly.



But by and by the thing dragged through, and everything was sold

--everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard.  So they'd got

to work that off--I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting

to swallow EVERYTHING.  Well, whilst they was at it a steamboat landed,

and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and

laughing and carrying on, and singing out:



"HERE'S your opposition line! here's your two sets o' heirs to old Peter

Wilks--and you pays your money and you takes your choice!"









CHAPTER XXIX.





THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a

nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling.  And, my souls,

how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up.  But I didn't see no

joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to

see any.  I reckoned they'd turn pale.  But no, nary a pale did THEY

turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went

a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that's googling out

buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful

on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to

think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world.  Oh, he done

it admirable.  Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to

let him see they was on his side.  That old gentleman that had just come

looked all puzzled to death.  Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see

straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman--not the king's way, though

the king's WAS pretty good for an imitation.  I can't give the old gent's

words, nor I can't imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and

says, about like this:



"This is a surprise to me which I wasn't looking for; and I'll

acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain't very well fixed to meet it and

answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he's broke his arm,

and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night

by a mistake.  I am Peter Wilks' brother Harvey, and this is his brother

William, which can't hear nor speak--and can't even make signs to amount

to much, now't he's only got one hand to work them with.  We are who we

say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it.

But up till then I won't say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait."



So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and

blethers out:



"Broke his arm--VERY likely, AIN'T it?--and very convenient, too, for a

fraud that's got to make signs, and ain't learnt how.  Lost their

baggage! That's MIGHTY good!--and mighty ingenious--under the

CIRCUMSTANCES!"



So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or

maybe half a dozen.  One of these was that doctor; another one was a

sharp-looking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made

out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was

talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then

and nodding their heads--it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to

Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and

listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king

now. And when the king got done this husky up and says:



"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when'd you come to this town?"



"The day before the funeral, friend," says the king.



"But what time o' day?"



"In the evenin'--'bout an hour er two before sundown."



"HOW'D you come?"



"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati."



"Well, then, how'd you come to be up at the Pint in the MORNIN'--in a

canoe?"



"I warn't up at the Pint in the mornin'."



"It's a lie."



Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an

old man and a preacher.



"Preacher be hanged, he's a fraud and a liar.  He was up at the Pint that

mornin'.  I live up there, don't I?  Well, I was up there, and he was up

there.  I see him there.  He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and

a boy."



The doctor he up and says:



"Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?"



"I reckon I would, but I don't know.  Why, yonder he is, now.  I know him

perfectly easy."



It was me he pointed at.  The doctor says:



"Neighbors, I don't know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if

THESE two ain't frauds, I am an idiot, that's all.  I think it's our duty

to see that they don't get away from here till we've looked into this

thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you.  We'll take these

fellows to the tavern and affront them with t'other couple, and I reckon

we'll find out SOMETHING before we get through."



It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king's friends; so we

all started.  It was about sundown.  The doctor he led me along by the

hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand.



We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and

fetched in the new couple.  First, the doctor says:



"I don't wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they're

frauds, and they may have complices that we don't know nothing about.  If

they have, won't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks

left?  It ain't unlikely.  If these men ain't frauds, they won't object

to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're

all right--ain't that so?"



Everybody agreed to that.  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty

tight place right at the outstart.  But the king he only looked

sorrowful, and says:



"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain't got no disposition to

throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o'

this misable business; but, alas, the money ain't there; you k'n send and

see, if you want to."



"Where is it, then?"



"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it

inside o' the straw tick o' my bed, not wishin' to bank it for the few

days we'd be here, and considerin' the bed a safe place, we not bein'

used to niggers, and suppos'n' 'em honest, like servants in England.  The

niggers stole it the very next mornin' after I had went down stairs; and

when I sold 'em I hadn't missed the money yit, so they got clean away

with it.  My servant here k'n tell you 'bout it, gentlemen."



The doctor and several said "Shucks!" and I see nobody didn't altogether

believe him.  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it.  I said no,

but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never

thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my

master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them.  That

was all they asked me.  Then the doctor whirls on me and says:



"Are YOU English, too?"



I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, "Stuff!"



Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had

it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about

supper, nor ever seemed to think about it--and so they kept it up, and

kept it up; and it WAS the worst mixed-up thing you ever see.  They made

the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his'n; and

anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old

gentleman was spinning truth and t'other one lies.  And by and by they

had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed look

out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right

side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all

about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty fur till

the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:



"Set down, my boy; I wouldn't strain myself if I was you.  I reckon you

ain't used to lying, it don't seem to come handy; what you want is

practice.  You do it pretty awkward."



I didn't care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off,

anyway.



The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:



"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell--" The king broke in and

reached out his hand, and says:



"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often

about?"



The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased,

and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked

low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says:



"That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your

brother's, and then they'll know it's all right."



So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted

his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;

and then they give the pen to the duke--and then for the first time the

duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer

turns to the new old gentleman and says:



"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names."



The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn't read it.  The lawyer looked

powerful astonished, and says:



"Well, it beats ME"--and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,

and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then THEM

again; and then says:  "These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and

here's THESE two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't write

them" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see

how the lawyer had took them in), "and here's THIS old gentleman's hand

writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, HE didn't write them--fact

is, the scratches he makes ain't properly WRITING at all.  Now, here's

some letters from--"



The new old gentleman says:



"If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother

there--so he copies for me.  It's HIS hand you've got there, not mine."



"WELL!" says the lawyer, "this IS a state of things.  I've got some of

William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we can

com--"



"He CAN'T write with his left hand," says the old gentleman.  "If he

could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and

mine too.  Look at both, please--they're by the same hand."



The lawyer done it, and says:



"I believe it's so--and if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger

resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I

thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,

partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved--THESE two ain't either of 'em

Wilkses"--and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.



Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in THEN!

Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his brother

William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried to write

--HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the

pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he

was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIMSELF; but pretty

soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:



"I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay out

my br--helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?"



"Yes," says somebody, "me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here."



Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:



"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?"



Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a

squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him

so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most

ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice,

because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man?  He

whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in there,

and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says I to

myself, NOW he'll throw up the sponge--there ain't no more use.  Well,

did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon he

thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they'd

thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.  Anyway,

he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:



"Mf!  It's a VERY tough question, AIN'T it!  YES, sir, I k'n tell you

what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue arrow

--that's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.  NOW

what do you say--hey?"



Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out

cheek.



The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his

eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king THIS time, and says:



"There--you've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter

Wilks' breast?"



Both of them spoke up and says:



"We didn't see no such mark."



"Good!" says the old gentleman.  "Now, what you DID see on his breast was

a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was

young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  P--B--W"--and he marked

them that way on a piece of paper.  "Come, ain't that what you saw?"



Both of them spoke up again, and says:



"No, we DIDN'T.  We never seen any marks at all."



Well, everybody WAS in a state of mind now, and they sings out:



"The whole BILIN' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em! le's

ride 'em on a rail!" and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a

rattling powwow.  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and

says:



"Gentlemen--gentleMEN!  Hear me just a word--just a SINGLE word--if you

PLEASE!  There's one way yet--let's go and dig up the corpse and look."



That took them.



"Hooray!" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer

and the doctor sung out:



"Hold on, hold on!  Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch THEM

along, too!"



"We'll do it!" they all shouted; "and if we don't find them marks we'll

lynch the whole gang!"



I WAS scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you

know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the

graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town

at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the

evening.



As we went by our house I wished I hadn't sent Mary Jane out of town;

because now if I could tip her the wink she'd light out and save me, and

blow on our dead-beats.



Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like

wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the

lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst

the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever

was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from

what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time

if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to

save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the

world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks.  If they

didn't find them--



I couldn't bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn't think

about nothing else.  It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful

time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist

--Hines--and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip.  He dragged

me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up.



When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it

like an overflow.  And when they got to the grave they found they had

about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn't

thought to fetch a lantern.  But they sailed into digging anyway by the

flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a

mile off, to borrow one.



So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain

started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come

brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took

no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you

could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls

of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped

it all out, and you couldn't see nothing at all.



At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then

such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to

scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it

was awful.  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I

reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting.



All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and

somebody sings out:



"By the living jingo, here's the bag of gold on his breast!"



Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give

a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and

shinned for the road in the dark there ain't nobody can tell.



I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew--leastways, I had it all

to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the

buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of

the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along!



When I struck the town I see there warn't nobody out in the storm, so I

never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main

one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it.

No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and

disappointed, I didn't know why.  But at last, just as I was sailing by,

FLASH comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up

sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me

in the dark, and wasn't ever going to be before me no more in this world.

She WAS the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.



The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the

towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time

the lightning showed me one that wasn't chained I snatched it and shoved.

It was a canoe, and warn't fastened with nothing but a rope.  The towhead

was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the

river, but I didn't lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I

was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could

afforded it.  But I didn't.  As I sprung aboard I sung out:



"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose!  Glory be to goodness, we're shut

of them!"



Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so

full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in

my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King

Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and

lights out of me.  But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and

bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the

king and the duke, but I says:



"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast!  Cut loose and

let her slide!"



So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it DID seem

so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and

nobody to bother us.  I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack

my heels a few times--I couldn't help it; but about the third crack I

noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and

listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over

the water, here they come!--and just a-laying to their oars and making

their skiff hum!  It was the king and the duke.



So I wilted right down on to the planks then, and give up; and it was all

I could do to keep from crying.









CHAPTER XXX.



WHEN they got aboard the king went for me, and shook me by the collar,

and says:



"Tryin' to give us the slip, was ye, you pup!  Tired of our company,

hey?"



I says:



"No, your majesty, we warn't--PLEASE don't, your majesty!"



"Quick, then, and tell us what WAS your idea, or I'll shake the insides

out o' you!"



"Honest, I'll tell you everything just as it happened, your majesty.  The

man that had a-holt of me was very good to me, and kept saying he had a

boy about as big as me that died last year, and he was sorry to see a boy

in such a dangerous fix; and when they was all took by surprise by

finding the gold, and made a rush for the coffin, he lets go of me and

whispers, 'Heel it now, or they'll hang ye, sure!' and I lit out.  It

didn't seem no good for ME to stay--I couldn't do nothing, and I didn't

want to be hung if I could get away.  So I never stopped running till I

found the canoe; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry, or they'd catch

me and hang me yet, and said I was afeard you and the duke wasn't alive

now, and I was awful sorry, and so was Jim, and was awful glad when we

see you coming; you may ask Jim if I didn't."



Jim said it was so; and the king told him to shut up, and said, "Oh, yes,

it's MIGHTY likely!" and shook me up again, and said he reckoned he'd

drownd me.  But the duke says:



"Leggo the boy, you old idiot!  Would YOU a done any different?  Did you

inquire around for HIM when you got loose?  I don't remember it."



So the king let go of me, and begun to cuss that town and everybody in

it. But the duke says:



"You better a blame' sight give YOURSELF a good cussing, for you're the

one that's entitled to it most.  You hain't done a thing from the start

that had any sense in it, except coming out so cool and cheeky with that

imaginary blue-arrow mark.  That WAS bright--it was right down bully; and

it was the thing that saved us.  For if it hadn't been for that they'd a

jailed us till them Englishmen's baggage come--and then--the

penitentiary, you bet! But that trick took 'em to the graveyard, and the

gold done us a still bigger kindness; for if the excited fools hadn't let

go all holts and made that rush to get a look we'd a slept in our cravats

to-night--cravats warranted to WEAR, too--longer than WE'D need 'em."



They was still a minute--thinking; then the king says, kind of

absent-minded like:



"Mf!  And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it!"



That made me squirm!



"Yes," says the duke, kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic, "WE did."



After about a half a minute the king drawls out:



"Leastways, I did."



The duke says, the same way:



"On the contrary, I did."



The king kind of ruffles up, and says:



"Looky here, Bilgewater, what'r you referrin' to?"



The duke says, pretty brisk:



"When it comes to that, maybe you'll let me ask, what was YOU referring

to?"



"Shucks!" says the king, very sarcastic; "but I don't know--maybe you was

asleep, and didn't know what you was about."



The duke bristles up now, and says:



"Oh, let UP on this cussed nonsense; do you take me for a blame' fool?

Don't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin?"



"YES, sir!  I know you DO know, because you done it yourself!"



"It's a lie!"--and the duke went for him.  The king sings out:



"Take y'r hands off!--leggo my throat!--I take it all back!"



The duke says:



"Well, you just own up, first, that you DID hide that money there,

intending to give me the slip one of these days, and come back and dig it

up, and have it all to yourself."



"Wait jest a minute, duke--answer me this one question, honest and fair;

if you didn't put the money there, say it, and I'll b'lieve you, and take

back everything I said."



"You old scoundrel, I didn't, and you know I didn't.  There, now!"



"Well, then, I b'lieve you.  But answer me only jest this one more--now

DON'T git mad; didn't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide

it?"



The duke never said nothing for a little bit; then he says:



"Well, I don't care if I DID, I didn't DO it, anyway.  But you not only

had it in mind to do it, but you DONE it."



"I wisht I never die if I done it, duke, and that's honest.  I won't say

I warn't goin' to do it, because I WAS; but you--I mean somebody--got in

ahead o' me."



"It's a lie!  You done it, and you got to SAY you done it, or--"



The king began to gurgle, and then he gasps out:



"'Nough!--I OWN UP!"



I was very glad to hear him say that; it made me feel much more easier

than what I was feeling before.  So the duke took his hands off and says:



"If you ever deny it again I'll drown you.  It's WELL for you to set

there and blubber like a baby--it's fitten for you, after the way you've

acted. I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything

--and I a-trusting you all the time, like you was my own father.  You ought

to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot

of poor niggers, and you never say a word for 'em.  It makes me feel

ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage.  Cuss you,

I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit--you wanted

to get what money I'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another,

and scoop it ALL!"



The king says, timid, and still a-snuffling:



"Why, duke, it was you that said make up the deffisit; it warn't me."



"Dry up!  I don't want to hear no more out of you!" says the duke.  "And

NOW you see what you GOT by it.  They've got all their own money back,

and all of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES.  G'long to bed, and don't

you deffersit ME no more deffersits, long 's YOU live!"



So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort,

and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle; and so in about a half an

hour they was as thick as thieves again, and the tighter they got the

lovinger they got, and went off a-snoring in each other's arms.  They

both got powerful mellow, but I noticed the king didn't get mellow enough

to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again.  That

made me feel easy and satisfied.  Of course when they got to snoring we

had a long gabble, and I told Jim everything.









CHAPTER XXXI.



WE dasn't stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down

the river.  We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long

ways from home.  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them,

hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the first I

ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal.  So

now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work

the villages again.



First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough for

them both to get drunk on.  Then in another village they started a

dancing-school; but they didn't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo

does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and

pranced them out of town.  Another time they tried to go at yellocution;

but they didn't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a

solid good cussing, and made them skip out.  They tackled missionarying,

and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of

everything; but they couldn't seem to have no luck.  So at last they got

just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along,

thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a

time, and dreadful blue and desperate.



And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in

the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time.

Jim and me got uneasy.  We didn't like the look of it.  We judged they

was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever.  We turned it over

and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into

somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money

business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an

agreement that we wouldn't have nothing in the world to do with such

actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold

shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid

the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a

shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us

all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if

anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. ("House to rob,

you MEAN," says I to myself; "and when you get through robbing it you'll

come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft--and

you'll have to take it out in wondering.") And he said if he warn't back

by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come

along.



So we stayed where we was.  The duke he fretted and sweated around, and

was in a mighty sour way.  He scolded us for everything, and we couldn't

seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing.

Something was a-brewing, sure.  I was good and glad when midday come and

no king; we could have a change, anyway--and maybe a chance for THE

chance on top of it.  So me and the duke went up to the village, and

hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back

room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers

bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all

his might, and so tight he couldn't walk, and couldn't do nothing to

them.  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun

to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook

the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer,

for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day

before they ever see me and Jim again.  I got down there all out of

breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out:



"Set her loose, Jim! we're all right now!"



But there warn't no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam.  Jim was

gone!  I set up a shout--and then another--and then another one; and run

this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn't no

use--old Jim was gone.  Then I set down and cried; I couldn't help it.

But I couldn't set still long.  Pretty soon I went out on the road,

trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and

asked him if he'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says:



"Yes."



"Whereabouts?" says I.



"Down to Silas Phelps' place, two mile below here.  He's a runaway

nigger, and they've got him.  Was you looking for him?"



"You bet I ain't!  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two

ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay

down and stay where I was; and I done it.  Been there ever since; afeard

to come out."



"Well," he says, "you needn't be afeard no more, becuz they've got him.

He run off f'm down South, som'ers."



"It's a good job they got him."



"Well, I RECKON!  There's two hunderd dollars reward on him.  It's like

picking up money out'n the road."



"Yes, it is--and I could a had it if I'd been big enough; I see him

FIRST. Who nailed him?"



"It was an old fellow--a stranger--and he sold out his chance in him for

forty dollars, becuz he's got to go up the river and can't wait.  Think

o' that, now!  You bet I'D wait, if it was seven year."



"That's me, every time," says I.  "But maybe his chance ain't worth no

more than that, if he'll sell it so cheap.  Maybe there's something ain't

straight about it."



"But it IS, though--straight as a string.  I see the handbill myself.  It

tells all about him, to a dot--paints him like a picture, and tells the

plantation he's frum, below NewrLEANS.  No-sirree-BOB, they ain't no

trouble 'bout THAT speculation, you bet you.  Say, gimme a chaw tobacker,

won't ye?"



I didn't have none, so he left.  I went to the raft, and set down in the

wigwam to think.  But I couldn't come to nothing.  I thought till I wore

my head sore, but I couldn't see no way out of the trouble.  After all

this long journey, and after all we'd done for them scoundrels, here it

was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because

they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him

a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty

dollars.



Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a

slave at home where his family was, as long as he'd GOT to be a slave,

and so I'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss

Watson where he was.  But I soon give up that notion for two things:

she'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for

leaving her, and so she'd sell him straight down the river again; and if

she didn't, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they'd

make Jim feel it all the time, and so he'd feel ornery and disgraced.

And then think of ME!  It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a

nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that

town again I'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame.  That's

just the way:  a person does a low-down thing, and then he don't want to

take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide, it ain't no

disgrace.  That was my fix exactly.  The more I studied about this the

more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down

and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden

that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and

letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up

there in heaven, whilst I was stealing a poor old woman's nigger that

hadn't ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there's One that's

always on the lookout, and ain't a-going to allow no such miserable

doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks

I was so scared.  Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up

somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn't so

much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, "There was the

Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd a done it they'd a

learnt you there that people that acts as I'd been acting about that

nigger goes to everlasting fire."



It made me shiver.  And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I

couldn't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better.  So I

kneeled down.  But the words wouldn't come.  Why wouldn't they?  It

warn't no use to try and hide it from Him.  Nor from ME, neither.  I

knowed very well why they wouldn't come.  It was because my heart warn't

right; it was because I warn't square; it was because I was playing

double.  I was letting ON to give up sin, but away inside of me I was

holding on to the biggest one of all.  I was trying to make my mouth SAY

I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that

nigger's owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was

a lie, and He knowed it.  You can't pray a lie--I found that out.



So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do.

At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter--and then

see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a

feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I got a piece

of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:



Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below

Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the

reward if you send.



HUCK FINN.



I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever

felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it

straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking--thinking

how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost

and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our

trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day

and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we

a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I

couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the

other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of

calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I

come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up

there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me

honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how

good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling

the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was

the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he's got

now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.



It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was

a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and

I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then

says to myself:



"All right, then, I'll GO to hell"--and tore it up.



It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let them

stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the whole

thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which

was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And for a

starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I

could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I

was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog.



Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some

considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that

suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down

the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my

raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the

night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and

put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another

in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed below

where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and

then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk

her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a

mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.



Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it,

"Phelps's Sawmill," and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three

hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't see nobody

around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind, because I

didn't want to see nobody just yet--I only wanted to get the lay of the

land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the

village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,

straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was

the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch--three-night

performance--like that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I

was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:



"Hel-LO!  Where'd YOU come from?"  Then he says, kind of glad and eager,

"Where's the raft?--got her in a good place?"



I says:



"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace."



Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:



"What was your idea for asking ME?" he says.



"Well," I says, "when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to

myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went

a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered

me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a

sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and

the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him

along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after

him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the

country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we

fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and

see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to

leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in

the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property no

more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and

cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what DID become of the raft,

then?--and Jim--poor Jim!"



"Blamed if I know--that is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had

made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery

the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what

he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found

the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and shook

us, and run off down the river.'"



"I wouldn't shake my NIGGER, would I?--the only nigger I had in the

world, and the only property."



"We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him

OUR nigger; yes, we did consider him so--goodness knows we had trouble

enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,

there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake.

And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's that ten

cents? Give it here."



I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to

spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the

money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never

said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:



"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done

that!"



"How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?"



"No!  That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money's

gone."



"SOLD him?"  I says, and begun to cry; "why, he was MY nigger, and that

was my money.  Where is he?--I want my nigger."



"Well, you can't GET your nigger, that's all--so dry up your blubbering.

Looky here--do you think YOU'D venture to blow on us?  Blamed if I think

I'd trust you.  Why, if you WAS to blow on us--"



He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before.

I went on a-whimpering, and says:



"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.

I got to turn out and find my nigger."



He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on

his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:



"I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll

promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you

where to find him."



So I promised, and he says:



"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph--" and then he stopped.  You see, he

started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to

study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he

was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the

way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:



"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster--Abram G. Foster--and he

lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette."



"All right," I says, "I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this

very afternoon."



"No you wont, you'll start NOW; and don't you lose any time about it,

neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in

your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with

US, d'ye hear?"



That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I wanted

to be left free to work my plans.



"So clear out," he says; "and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want

to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your nigger--some idiots

don't require documents--leastways I've heard there's such down South

here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus, maybe

he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting

'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you

don't work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there."



So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I

kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out

at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I

stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I

reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling

around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could get

away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I wanted

to of them, and wanted to get entirely shut of them.









CHAPTER XXXII.



WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like, and hot and sunshiny;

the hands was gone to the fields; and there was them kind of faint

dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and

like everybody's dead and gone; and if a breeze fans along and quivers

the leaves it makes you feel mournful, because you feel like it's spirits

whispering--spirits that's been dead ever so many years--and you always

think they're talking about YOU.  As a general thing it makes a body wish

HE was dead, too, and done with it all.



Phelps' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations, and they

all look alike.  A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of

logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length,

to climb over the fence with, and for the women to stand on when they are

going to jump on to a horse; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard,

but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed

off; big double log-house for the white folks--hewed logs, with the

chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud-stripes been

whitewashed some time or another; round-log kitchen, with a big broad,

open but roofed passage joining it to the house; log smoke-house back of

the kitchen; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t'other side the

smoke-house; one little hut all by itself away down against the back

fence, and some outbuildings down a piece the other side; ash-hopper and

big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut; bench by the kitchen door,

with bucket of water and a gourd; hound asleep there in the sun; more

hounds asleep round about; about three shade trees away off in a corner;

some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence;

outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cotton

fields begins, and after the fields the woods.



I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper, and

started for the kitchen.  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of

a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again; and then

I knowed for certain I wished I was dead--for that IS the lonesomest

sound in the whole world.



I went right along, not fixing up any particular plan, but just trusting

to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come; for

I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if

I left it alone.



When I got half-way, first one hound and then another got up and went for

me, and of course I stopped and faced them, and kept still.  And such

another powwow as they made!  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a

hub of a wheel, as you may say--spokes made out of dogs--circle of

fifteen of them packed together around me, with their necks and noses

stretched up towards me, a-barking and howling; and more a-coming; you

could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres.



A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her

hand, singing out, "Begone YOU Tige! you Spot! begone sah!" and she

fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling,

and then the rest followed; and the next second half of them come back,

wagging their tails around me, and making friends with me.  There ain't

no harm in a hound, nohow.



And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger

boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts, and they hung on to their

mother's gown, and peeped out from behind her at me, bashful, the way

they always do.  And here comes the white woman running from the house,

about forty-five or fifty year old, bareheaded, and her spinning-stick in

her hand; and behind her comes her little white children, acting the same

way the little niggers was going.  She was smiling all over so she could

hardly stand--and says:



"It's YOU, at last!--AIN'T it?"



I out with a "Yes'm" before I thought.



She grabbed me and hugged me tight; and then gripped me by both hands and

shook and shook; and the tears come in her eyes, and run down over; and

she couldn't seem to hug and shake enough, and kept saying, "You don't

look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would; but law sakes, I

don't care for that, I'm so glad to see you!  Dear, dear, it does seem

like I could eat you up!  Children, it's your cousin Tom!--tell him

howdy."



But they ducked their heads, and put their fingers in their mouths, and

hid behind her.  So she run on:



"Lize, hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away--or did you get

your breakfast on the boat?"



I said I had got it on the boat.  So then she started for the house,

leading me by the hand, and the children tagging after.  When we got

there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair, and set herself down on

a little low stool in front of me, holding both of my hands, and says:



"Now I can have a GOOD look at you; and, laws-a-me, I've been hungry for

it a many and a many a time, all these long years, and it's come at last!

We been expecting you a couple of days and more.  What kep' you?--boat

get aground?"



"Yes'm--she--"



"Don't say yes'm--say Aunt Sally.  Where'd she get aground?"



I didn't rightly know what to say, because I didn't know whether the boat

would be coming up the river or down.  But I go a good deal on instinct;

and my instinct said she would be coming up--from down towards Orleans.

That didn't help me much, though; for I didn't know the names of bars

down that way.  I see I'd got to invent a bar, or forget the name of the

one we got aground on--or--Now I struck an idea, and fetched it out:



"It warn't the grounding--that didn't keep us back but a little.  We

blowed out a cylinder-head."



"Good gracious! anybody hurt?"



"No'm.  Killed a nigger."



"Well, it's lucky; because sometimes people do get hurt.  Two years ago

last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old

Lally Rook, and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man.  And I

think he died afterwards.  He was a Baptist.  Your uncle Silas knowed a

family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well.  Yes, I remember

now, he DID die.  Mortification set in, and they had to amputate him.

But it didn't save him.  Yes, it was mortification--that was it.  He

turned blue all over, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection.

They say he was a sight to look at.  Your uncle's been up to the town

every day to fetch you. And he's gone again, not more'n an hour ago;

he'll be back any minute now. You must a met him on the road, didn't

you?--oldish man, with a--"



"No, I didn't see nobody, Aunt Sally.  The boat landed just at daylight,

and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town

and out a piece in the country, to put in the time and not get here too

soon; and so I come down the back way."



"Who'd you give the baggage to?"



"Nobody."



"Why, child, it 'll be stole!"



"Not where I hid it I reckon it won't," I says.



"How'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat?"



It was kinder thin ice, but I says:



"The captain see me standing around, and told me I better have something

to eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers'

lunch, and give me all I wanted."



I was getting so uneasy I couldn't listen good.  I had my mind on the

children all the time; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them

a little, and find out who I was.  But I couldn't get no show, Mrs.

Phelps kept it up and run on so.  Pretty soon she made the cold chills

streak all down my back, because she says:



"But here we're a-running on this way, and you hain't told me a word

about Sis, nor any of them.  Now I'll rest my works a little, and you

start up yourn; just tell me EVERYTHING--tell me all about 'm all every

one of 'm; and how they are, and what they're doing, and what they told

you to tell me; and every last thing you can think of."



Well, I see I was up a stump--and up it good.  Providence had stood by me

this fur all right, but I was hard and tight aground now.  I see it

warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead--I'd got to throw up my hand.  So

I says to myself, here's another place where I got to resk the truth.  I

opened my mouth to begin; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the

bed, and says:



"Here he comes!  Stick your head down lower--there, that'll do; you can't

be seen now.  Don't you let on you're here.  I'll play a joke on him.

Children, don't you say a word."



I see I was in a fix now.  But it warn't no use to worry; there warn't

nothing to do but just hold still, and try and be ready to stand from

under when the lightning struck.



I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in; then

the bed hid him.  Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him, and says:



"Has he come?"



"No," says her husband.



"Good-NESS gracious!" she says, "what in the warld can have become of

him?"



"I can't imagine," says the old gentleman; "and I must say it makes me

dreadful uneasy."



"Uneasy!" she says; "I'm ready to go distracted!  He MUST a come; and

you've missed him along the road.  I KNOW it's so--something tells me

so."



"Why, Sally, I COULDN'T miss him along the road--YOU know that."



"But oh, dear, dear, what WILL Sis say!  He must a come!  You must a

missed him.  He--"



"Oh, don't distress me any more'n I'm already distressed.  I don't know

what in the world to make of it.  I'm at my wit's end, and I don't mind

acknowledging 't I'm right down scared.  But there's no hope that he's

come; for he COULDN'T come and me miss him.  Sally, it's terrible--just

terrible--something's happened to the boat, sure!"



"Why, Silas!  Look yonder!--up the road!--ain't that somebody coming?"



He sprung to the window at the head of the bed, and that give Mrs. Phelps

the chance she wanted.  She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and

give me a pull, and out I come; and when he turned back from the window

there she stood, a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire, and I

standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside.  The old gentleman stared, and

says:



"Why, who's that?"



"Who do you reckon 't is?"



"I hain't no idea.  Who IS it?"



"It's TOM SAWYER!"



By jings, I most slumped through the floor!  But there warn't no time to

swap knives; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook, and kept on

shaking; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and

cry; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid, and Mary,

and the rest of the tribe.



But if they was joyful, it warn't nothing to what I was; for it was like

being born again, I was so glad to find out who I was.  Well, they froze

to me for two hours; and at last, when my chin was so tired it couldn't

hardly go any more, I had told them more about my family--I mean the

Sawyer family--than ever happened to any six Sawyer families.  And I

explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of

White River, and it took us three days to fix it.  Which was all right,

and worked first-rate; because THEY didn't know but what it would take

three days to fix it.  If I'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just

as well.



Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side, and pretty

uncomfortable all up the other.  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and

comfortable, and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a

steamboat coughing along down the river.  Then I says to myself, s'pose

Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat?  And s'pose he steps in here any

minute, and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep

quiet?



Well, I couldn't HAVE it that way; it wouldn't do at all.  I must go up

the road and waylay him.  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to

the town and fetch down my baggage.  The old gentleman was for going

along with me, but I said no, I could drive the horse myself, and I

druther he wouldn't take no trouble about me.









CHAPTER XXXIII.



SO I started for town in the wagon, and when I was half-way I see a wagon

coming, and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer, and I stopped and waited till

he come along.  I says "Hold on!" and it stopped alongside, and his mouth

opened up like a trunk, and stayed so; and he swallowed two or three

times like a person that's got a dry throat, and then says:



"I hain't ever done you no harm.  You know that.  So, then, what you want

to come back and ha'nt ME for?"



I says:



"I hain't come back--I hain't been GONE."



When he heard my voice it righted him up some, but he warn't quite

satisfied yet.  He says:



"Don't you play nothing on me, because I wouldn't on you.  Honest injun,

you ain't a ghost?"



"Honest injun, I ain't," I says.



"Well--I--I--well, that ought to settle it, of course; but I can't

somehow seem to understand it no way.  Looky here, warn't you ever

murdered AT ALL?"



"No.  I warn't ever murdered at all--I played it on them.  You come in

here and feel of me if you don't believe me."



So he done it; and it satisfied him; and he was that glad to see me again

he didn't know what to do.  And he wanted to know all about it right off,

because it was a grand adventure, and mysterious, and so it hit him where

he lived.  But I said, leave it alone till by and by; and told his driver

to wait, and we drove off a little piece, and I told him the kind of a

fix I was in, and what did he reckon we better do?  He said, let him

alone a minute, and don't disturb him.  So he thought and thought, and

pretty soon he says:



"It's all right; I've got it.  Take my trunk in your wagon, and let on

it's your'n; and you turn back and fool along slow, so as to get to the

house about the time you ought to; and I'll go towards town a piece, and

take a fresh start, and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you;

and you needn't let on to know me at first."



I says:



"All right; but wait a minute.  There's one more thing--a thing that

NOBODY don't know but me.  And that is, there's a nigger here that I'm

a-trying to steal out of slavery, and his name is JIM--old Miss Watson's

Jim."



He says:



"What!  Why, Jim is--"



He stopped and went to studying.  I says:



"I know what you'll say.  You'll say it's dirty, low-down business; but

what if it is?  I'm low down; and I'm a-going to steal him, and I want

you keep mum and not let on.  Will you?"



His eye lit up, and he says:



"I'll HELP you steal him!"



Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot.  It was the most

astonishing speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell

considerable in my estimation.  Only I couldn't believe it.  Tom Sawyer a

NIGGER-STEALER!



"Oh, shucks!"  I says; "you're joking."



"I ain't joking, either."



"Well, then," I says, "joking or no joking, if you hear anything said

about a runaway nigger, don't forget to remember that YOU don't know

nothing about him, and I don't know nothing about him."



Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon, and he drove off his way

and I drove mine.  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on

accounts of being glad and full of thinking; so I got home a heap too

quick for that length of a trip.  The old gentleman was at the door, and

he says:



"Why, this is wonderful!  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to

do it?  I wish we'd a timed her.  And she hain't sweated a hair--not a

hair. It's wonderful.  Why, I wouldn't take a hundred dollars for that

horse now--I wouldn't, honest; and yet I'd a sold her for fifteen

before, and thought 'twas all she was worth."



That's all he said.  He was the innocentest, best old soul I ever see.

But it warn't surprising; because he warn't only just a farmer, he was a

preacher, too, and had a little one-horse log church down back of the

plantation, which he built it himself at his own expense, for a church

and schoolhouse, and never charged nothing for his preaching, and it was

worth it, too.  There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that, and

done the same way, down South.



In about half an hour Tom's wagon drove up to the front stile, and Aunt

Sally she see it through the window, because it was only about fifty

yards, and says:



"Why, there's somebody come!  I wonder who 'tis?  Why, I do believe it's

a stranger.  Jimmy" (that's one of the children) "run and tell Lize to

put on another plate for dinner."



Everybody made a rush for the front door, because, of course, a stranger

don't come EVERY year, and so he lays over the yaller-fever, for

interest, when he does come.  Tom was over the stile and starting for the

house; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village, and we was all

bunched in the front door.  Tom had his store clothes on, and an

audience--and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer.  In them circumstances

it warn't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was

suitable.  He warn't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep; no,

he come ca'm and important, like the ram.  When he got a-front of us he

lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty, like it was the lid of a box

that had butterflies asleep in it and he didn't want to disturb them, and

says:



"Mr. Archibald Nichols, I presume?"



"No, my boy," says the old gentleman, "I'm sorry to say 't your driver

has deceived you; Nichols's place is down a matter of three mile more.

Come in, come in."



Tom he took a look back over his shoulder, and says, "Too late--he's out

of sight."



"Yes, he's gone, my son, and you must come in and eat your dinner with

us; and then we'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols's."



"Oh, I CAN'T make you so much trouble; I couldn't think of it.  I'll walk

--I don't mind the distance."



"But we won't LET you walk--it wouldn't be Southern hospitality to do it.

Come right in."



"Oh, DO," says Aunt Sally; "it ain't a bit of trouble to us, not a bit in

the world.  You must stay.  It's a long, dusty three mile, and we can't

let you walk.  And, besides, I've already told 'em to put on another

plate when I see you coming; so you mustn't disappoint us.  Come right in

and make yourself at home."



So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome, and let himself be

persuaded, and come in; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from

Hicksville, Ohio, and his name was William Thompson--and he made another

bow.



Well, he run on, and on, and on, making up stuff about Hicksville and

everybody in it he could invent, and I getting a little nervious, and

wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape; and at last,

still talking along, he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the

mouth, and then settled back again in his chair comfortable, and was

going on talking; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her

hand, and says:



"You owdacious puppy!"



He looked kind of hurt, and says:



"I'm surprised at you, m'am."



"You're s'rp--Why, what do you reckon I am?  I've a good notion to take

and--Say, what do you mean by kissing me?"



He looked kind of humble, and says:



"I didn't mean nothing, m'am.  I didn't mean no harm.  I--I--thought

you'd like it."



"Why, you born fool!"  She took up the spinning stick, and it looked like

it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it.  "What

made you think I'd like it?"



"Well, I don't know.  Only, they--they--told me you would."



"THEY told you I would.  Whoever told you's ANOTHER lunatic.  I never

heard the beat of it.  Who's THEY?"



"Why, everybody.  They all said so, m'am."



It was all she could do to hold in; and her eyes snapped, and her fingers

worked like she wanted to scratch him; and she says:



"Who's 'everybody'?  Out with their names, or ther'll be an idiot short."



He got up and looked distressed, and fumbled his hat, and says:



"I'm sorry, and I warn't expecting it.  They told me to.  They all told

me to.  They all said, kiss her; and said she'd like it.  They all said

it--every one of them.  But I'm sorry, m'am, and I won't do it no more

--I won't, honest."



"You won't, won't you?  Well, I sh'd RECKON you won't!"



"No'm, I'm honest about it; I won't ever do it again--till you ask me."



"Till I ASK you!  Well, I never see the beat of it in my born days!  I

lay you'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you

--or the likes of you."



"Well," he says, "it does surprise me so.  I can't make it out, somehow.

They said you would, and I thought you would.  But--" He stopped and

looked around slow, like he wished he could run across a friendly eye

somewheres, and fetched up on the old gentleman's, and says, "Didn't YOU

think she'd like me to kiss her, sir?"



"Why, no; I--I--well, no, I b'lieve I didn't."



Then he looks on around the same way to me, and says:



"Tom, didn't YOU think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say, 'Sid

Sawyer--'"



"My land!" she says, breaking in and jumping for him, "you impudent young

rascal, to fool a body so--" and was going to hug him, but he fended her

off, and says:



"No, not till you've asked me first."



So she didn't lose no time, but asked him; and hugged him and kissed him

over and over again, and then turned him over to the old man, and he took

what was left.  And after they got a little quiet again she says:



"Why, dear me, I never see such a surprise.  We warn't looking for YOU at

all, but only Tom.  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him."



"It's because it warn't INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom," he says;

"but I begged and begged, and at the last minute she let me come, too;

so, coming down the river, me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate

surprise for him to come here to the house first, and for me to by and by

tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it was a

mistake, Aunt Sally.  This ain't no healthy place for a stranger to

come."



"No--not impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I

hain't been so put out since I don't know when.  But I don't care, I

don't mind the terms--I'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to

have you here. Well, to think of that performance!  I don't deny it, I

was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack."



We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the

kitchen; and there was things enough on that table for seven families

--and all hot, too; none of your flabby, tough meat that's laid in a

cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold

cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing

over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit, neither, the

way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.  There was a

considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me and Tom was on

the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they didn't happen to say

nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid to try to work up to

it.  But at supper, at night, one of the little boys says:



"Pa, mayn't Tom and Sid and me go to the show?"



"No," says the old man, "I reckon there ain't going to be any; and you

couldn't go if there was; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me

all about that scandalous show, and Burton said he would tell the people;

so I reckon they've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this

time."



So there it was!--but I couldn't help it.  Tom and me was to sleep in the

same room and bed; so, being tired, we bid good-night and went up to bed

right after supper, and clumb out of the window and down the

lightning-rod, and shoved for the town; for I didn't believe anybody was

going to give the king and the duke a hint, and so if I didn't hurry up

and give them one they'd get into trouble sure.



On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered,

and how pap disappeared pretty soon, and didn't come back no more, and

what a stir there was when Jim run away; and I told Tom all about our

Royal Nonesuch rapscallions, and as much of the raft voyage as I had time

to; and as we struck into the town and up through the--here comes a

raging rush of people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling,

and banging tin pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let

them go by; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke

astraddle of a rail--that is, I knowed it WAS the king and the duke,

though they was all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing

in the world that was human--just looked like a couple of monstrous big

soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for

them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any

hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to

see.  Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another.



We see we was too late--couldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglers

about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent;

and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of

his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and the house

rose up and went for them.



So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was

before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehow--though I

hadn't done nothing.  But that's always the way; it don't make no

difference whether you do right or wrong, a person's conscience ain't got

no sense, and just goes for him anyway.  If I had a yaller dog that

didn't know no more than a person's conscience does I would pison him.

It takes up more room than all the rest of a person's insides, and yet

ain't no good, nohow.  Tom Sawyer he says the same.









CHAPTER XXXIV.



WE stopped talking, and got to thinking.  By and by Tom says:



"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before!  I bet I

know where Jim is."



"No!  Where?"



"In that hut down by the ash-hopper.  Why, looky here.  When we was at

dinner, didn't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?"



"Yes."



"What did you think the vittles was for?"



"For a dog."



"So 'd I. Well, it wasn't for a dog."



"Why?"



"Because part of it was watermelon."



"So it was--I noticed it.  Well, it does beat all that I never thought

about a dog not eating watermelon.  It shows how a body can see and don't

see at the same time."



"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it

again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up

from table--same key, I bet.  Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner;

and it ain't likely there's two prisoners on such a little plantation,

and where the people's all so kind and good.  Jim's the prisoner.  All

right--I'm glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn't give

shucks for any other way.  Now you work your mind, and study out a plan

to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we'll take the one we

like the best."



What a head for just a boy to have!  If I had Tom Sawyer's head I

wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in

a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan, but

only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan

was going to come from.  Pretty soon Tom says:



"Ready?"



"Yes," I says.



"All right--bring it out."



"My plan is this," I says.  "We can easy find out if it's Jim in there.

Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the

island.  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the

old man's britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on

the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim

used to do before.  Wouldn't that plan work?"



"WORK?  Why, cert'nly it would work, like rats a-fighting.  But it's too

blame' simple; there ain't nothing TO it.  What's the good of a plan that

ain't no more trouble than that?  It's as mild as goose-milk.  Why, Huck,

it wouldn't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory."



I never said nothing, because I warn't expecting nothing different; but I

knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it wouldn't have

none of them objections to it.



And it didn't.  He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was

worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as

mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides.  So I was satisfied, and

said we would waltz in on it.  I needn't tell what it was here, because I

knowed it wouldn't stay the way, it was.  I knowed he would be changing

it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new

bullinesses wherever he got a chance.  And that is what he done.



Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in

earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.

That was the thing that was too many for me.  Here was a boy that was

respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at

home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and

knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was,

without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this

business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before

everybody.  I COULDN'T understand it no way at all.  It was outrageous,

and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his true

friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself.

And I DID start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:



"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know what I'm

about?"



"Yes."



"Didn't I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger?"



"Yes."



"WELL, then."



That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use to say any

more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it.  But I

couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let

it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have it

so, I couldn't help it.



When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to

the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard so

as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn't make no

more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in

the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the

two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted with--which was the north

side--we found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just one

stout board nailed across it.  I says:



"Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we

wrench off the board."



Tom says:



"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing

hooky.  I should HOPE we can find a way that's a little more complicated

than THAT, Huck Finn."



"Well, then," I says, "how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done

before I was murdered that time?"



"That's more LIKE," he says.  "It's real mysterious, and troublesome, and

good," he says; "but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.  There

ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around."



Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that

joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long

as the hut, but narrow--only about six foot wide.  The door to it was at

the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and

searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;

so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,

and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and

see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection with

it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old

rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.  The

match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the

door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;



"Now we're all right.  We'll DIG him out.  It 'll take about a week!"



Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door--you only have

to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doors--but that

warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must

climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three

times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted

his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he was

rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time

he made the trip.



In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins

to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim--if it WAS

Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through breakfast

and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up a tin pan

with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the

key come from the house.



This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all

tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches off.  He

said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see

all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and

noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so long before in his

life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles,

he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.  So Tom says:



"What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?"



The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you

heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:



"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at

'im?"



"Yes."



I hunched Tom, and whispers:



"You going, right here in the daybreak?  THAT warn't the plan."



"No, it warn't; but it's the plan NOW."



So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.  When we got in

we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure

enough, and could see us; and he sings out:



"Why, HUCK!  En good LAN'! ain' dat Misto Tom?"



I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't know nothing

to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger busted in

and says:



"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?"



We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and

kind of wondering, and says:



"Does WHO know us?"



"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger."



"I don't reckon he does; but what put that into your head?"



"What PUT it dar?  Didn' he jis' dis minute sing out like he knowed you?"



Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way:



"Well, that's mighty curious.  WHO sung out? WHEN did he sing out?  WHAT

did he sing out?" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says, "Did YOU

hear anybody sing out?"



Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:



"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing."



Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,

and says:



"Did you sing out?"



"No, sah," says Jim; "I hain't said nothing, sah."



"Not a word?"



"No, sah, I hain't said a word."



"Did you ever see us before?"



"No, sah; not as I knows on."



So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and

says, kind of severe:



"What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think

somebody sung out?"



"Oh, it's de dad-blame' witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do.  Dey's

awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos' kill me, dey sk'yers me so.  Please to

don't tell nobody 'bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he'll scole me; 'kase

he say dey AIN'T no witches.  I jis' wish to goodness he was heah now

--DEN what would he say!  I jis' bet he couldn' fine no way to git aroun'

it DIS time.  But it's awluz jis' so; people dat's SOT, stays sot; dey

won't look into noth'n'en fine it out f'r deyselves, en when YOU fine it

out en tell um 'bout it, dey doan' b'lieve you."



Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn't tell nobody; and told him to

buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and

says:



"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger.  If I was to catch

a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn't give him up,

I'd hang him."  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the

dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says:



"Don't ever let on to know us.  And if you hear any digging going on

nights, it's us; we're going to set you free."



Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger

come back, and we said we'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us

to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the

witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks

around then.









CHAPTER XXXV.



IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down

into the woods; because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to

dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what

we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that's called fox-fire, and

just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place.  We

fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom

says, kind of dissatisfied:



"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be.

And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan.  There

ain't no watchman to be drugged--now there OUGHT to be a watchman.  There

ain't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to.  And there's Jim chained

by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed:  why, all you

got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain.  And Uncle

Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and

don't send nobody to watch the nigger.  Jim could a got out of that

window-hole before this, only there wouldn't be no use trying to travel

with a ten-foot chain on his leg.  Why, drat it, Huck, it's the stupidest

arrangement I ever see. You got to invent ALL the difficulties.  Well, we

can't help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we've got.

Anyhow, there's one thing--there's more honor in getting him out

through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn't one of them

furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and

you had to contrive them all out of your own head.  Now look at just that

one thing of the lantern.  When you come down to the cold facts, we

simply got to LET ON that a lantern's resky.  Why, we could work with a

torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe.  Now, whilst I think of

it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we

get."



"What do we want of a saw?"



"What do we WANT of a saw?  Hain't we got to saw the leg of Jim's bed

off, so as to get the chain loose?"



"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain

off."



"Well, if that ain't just like you, Huck Finn.  You CAN get up the

infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing.  Why, hain't you ever read

any books at all?--Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny,

nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes?  Who ever heard of getting a

prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that?  No; the way all the

best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so,

and swallow the sawdust, so it can't be found, and put some dirt and

grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can't see no

sign of it's being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound.

Then, the night you're ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip

off your chain, and there you are.  Nothing to do but hitch your rope

ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat

--because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know--and there's

your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you

across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or

wherever it is. It's gaudy, Huck.  I wish there was a moat to this cabin.

If we get time, the night of the escape, we'll dig one."



I says:



"What do we want of a moat when we're going to snake him out from under

the cabin?"



But he never heard me.  He had forgot me and everything else.  He had his

chin in his hand, thinking.  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head;

then sighs again, and says:



"No, it wouldn't do--there ain't necessity enough for it."



"For what?"  I says.



"Why, to saw Jim's leg off," he says.



"Good land!"  I says; "why, there ain't NO necessity for it.  And what

would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?"



"Well, some of the best authorities has done it.  They couldn't get the

chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved.  And a leg would

be better still.  But we got to let that go.  There ain't necessity

enough in this case; and, besides, Jim's a nigger, and wouldn't

understand the reasons for it, and how it's the custom in Europe; so

we'll let it go.  But there's one thing--he can have a rope ladder; we

can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough.  And we

can send it to him in a pie; it's mostly done that way.  And I've et

worse pies."



"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk," I says; "Jim ain't got no use for a rope

ladder."



"He HAS got use for it.  How YOU talk, you better say; you don't know

nothing about it.  He's GOT to have a rope ladder; they all do."



"What in the nation can he DO with it?"



"DO with it?  He can hide it in his bed, can't he?"  That's what they all

do; and HE'S got to, too.  Huck, you don't ever seem to want to do

anything that's regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the

time. S'pose he DON'T do nothing with it? ain't it there in his bed, for

a clew, after he's gone? and don't you reckon they'll want clews?  Of

course they will.  And you wouldn't leave them any?  That would be a

PRETTY howdy-do, WOULDN'T it!  I never heard of such a thing."



"Well," I says, "if it's in the regulations, and he's got to have it, all

right, let him have it; because I don't wish to go back on no

regulations; but there's one thing, Tom Sawyer--if we go to tearing up

our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we're going to get into trouble

with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you're born.  Now, the way I look at it,

a hickry-bark ladder don't cost nothing, and don't waste nothing, and is

just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag

ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain't had no experience, and so

he don't care what kind of a--"



"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I'd keep still

--that's what I'D do.  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a

hickry-bark ladder?  Why, it's perfectly ridiculous."



"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you'll take my advice,

you'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline."



He said that would do.  And that gave him another idea, and he says:



"Borrow a shirt, too."



"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?"



"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on."



"Journal your granny--JIM can't write."



"S'pose he CAN'T write--he can make marks on the shirt, can't he, if we

make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron

barrel-hoop?"



"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better

one; and quicker, too."



"PRISONERS don't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens

out of, you muggins.  They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest,

toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like

that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and

months and months to file it out, too, because they've got to do it by

rubbing it on the wall.  THEY wouldn't use a goose-quill if they had it.

It ain't regular."



"Well, then, what'll we make him the ink out of?"



"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that's the common sort and

women; the best authorities uses their own blood.  Jim can do that; and

when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to

let the world know where he's captivated, he can write it on the bottom

of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window.  The Iron Mask

always done that, and it's a blame' good way, too."



"Jim ain't got no tin plates.  They feed him in a pan."



"That ain't nothing; we can get him some."



"Can't nobody READ his plates."



"That ain't got anything to DO with it, Huck Finn.  All HE'S got to do is

to write on the plate and throw it out.  You don't HAVE to be able to

read it. Why, half the time you can't read anything a prisoner writes on

a tin plate, or anywhere else."



"Well, then, what's the sense in wasting the plates?"



"Why, blame it all, it ain't the PRISONER'S plates."



"But it's SOMEBODY'S plates, ain't it?"



"Well, spos'n it is?  What does the PRISONER care whose--"



He broke off there, because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing.  So we

cleared out for the house.



Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the

clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went

down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too.  I called it borrowing,

because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn't

borrowing, it was stealing.  He said we was representing prisoners; and

prisoners don't care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody

don't blame them for it, either.  It ain't no crime in a prisoner to

steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it's his right; and

so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to

steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves

out of prison with.  He said if we warn't prisoners it would be a very

different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he

warn't a prisoner.  So we allowed we would steal everything there was

that come handy.  And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that,

when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made

me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for.

Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we NEEDED. Well,

I says, I needed the watermelon.  But he said I didn't need it to get out

of prison with; there's where the difference was.  He said if I'd a

wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal

with, it would a been all right.  So I let it go at that, though I

couldn't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set

down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I

see a chance to hog a watermelon.



Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled

down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he

carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep

watch.  By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile

to talk.  He says:



"Everything's all right now except tools; and that's easy fixed."



"Tools?"  I says.



"Yes."



"Tools for what?"



"Why, to dig with.  We ain't a-going to GNAW him out, are we?"



"Ain't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a

nigger out with?"  I says.



He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says:



"Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and

all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with?  Now

I want to ask you--if you got any reasonableness in you at all--what kind

of a show would THAT give him to be a hero?  Why, they might as well lend

him the key and done with it.  Picks and shovels--why, they wouldn't

furnish 'em to a king."



"Well, then," I says, "if we don't want the picks and shovels, what do we

want?"



"A couple of case-knives."



"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?"



"Yes."



"Confound it, it's foolish, Tom."



"It don't make no difference how foolish it is, it's the RIGHT way--and

it's the regular way.  And there ain't no OTHER way, that ever I heard

of, and I've read all the books that gives any information about these

things. They always dig out with a case-knife--and not through dirt, mind

you; generly it's through solid rock.  And it takes them weeks and weeks

and weeks, and for ever and ever.  Why, look at one of them prisoners in

the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that

dug himself out that way; how long was HE at it, you reckon?"



"I don't know."



"Well, guess."



"I don't know.  A month and a half."



"THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR--and he come out in China.  THAT'S the kind.  I wish

the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock."



"JIM don't know nobody in China."



"What's THAT got to do with it?  Neither did that other fellow.  But

you're always a-wandering off on a side issue.  Why can't you stick to

the main point?"



"All right--I don't care where he comes out, so he COMES out; and Jim

don't, either, I reckon.  But there's one thing, anyway--Jim's too old to

be dug out with a case-knife.  He won't last."



"Yes he will LAST, too.  You don't reckon it's going to take thirty-seven

years to dig out through a DIRT foundation, do you?"



"How long will it take, Tom?"



"Well, we can't resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn't take

very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans.  He'll

hear Jim ain't from there.  Then his next move will be to advertise Jim,

or something like that.  So we can't resk being as long digging him out

as we ought to.  By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but

we can't.  Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this:  that we

really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can LET ON,

to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years.  Then we can snatch

him out and rush him away the first time there's an alarm.  Yes, I reckon

that 'll be the best way."



"Now, there's SENSE in that," I says.  "Letting on don't cost nothing;

letting on ain't no trouble; and if it's any object, I don't mind letting

on we was at it a hundred and fifty year.  It wouldn't strain me none,

after I got my hand in.  So I'll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of

case-knives."



"Smouch three," he says; "we want one to make a saw out of."



"Tom, if it ain't unregular and irreligious to sejest it," I says,

"there's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the

weather-boarding behind the smoke-house."



He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says:



"It ain't no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck.  Run along and smouch

the knives--three of them."  So I done it.









CHAPTER XXXVI.



AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the

lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile

of fox-fire, and went to work.  We cleared everything out of the way,

about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log.  Tom said we

was right behind Jim's bed now, and we'd dig in under it, and when we got

through there couldn't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole

there, because Jim's counter-pin hung down most to the ground, and you'd

have to raise it up and look under to see the hole.  So we dug and dug

with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and

our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn't see we'd done anything

hardly.  At last I says:



"This ain't no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job,

Tom Sawyer."



He never said nothing.  But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped

digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking.

Then he says:



"It ain't no use, Huck, it ain't a-going to work.  If we was prisoners it

would, because then we'd have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry;

and we wouldn't get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was

changing watches, and so our hands wouldn't get blistered, and we could

keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the

way it ought to be done.  But WE can't fool along; we got to rush; we

ain't got no time to spare.  If we was to put in another night this way

we'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well--couldn't

touch a case-knife with them sooner."



"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?"



"I'll tell you.  It ain't right, and it ain't moral, and I wouldn't like

it to get out; but there ain't only just the one way:  we got to dig him

out with the picks, and LET ON it's case-knives."



"NOW you're TALKING!"  I says; "your head gets leveler and leveler all

the time, Tom Sawyer," I says.  "Picks is the thing, moral or no moral;

and as for me, I don't care shucks for the morality of it, nohow.  When I

start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I

ain't no ways particular how it's done so it's done.  What I want is my

nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my

Sunday-school book; and if a pick's the handiest thing, that's the thing

I'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school

book out with; and I don't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks

about it nuther."



"Well," he says, "there's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like

this; if it warn't so, I wouldn't approve of it, nor I wouldn't stand by

and see the rules broke--because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and

a body ain't got no business doing wrong when he ain't ignorant and knows

better.  It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT any

letting on, because you don't know no better; but it wouldn't for me,

because I do know better.  Gimme a case-knife."



He had his own by him, but I handed him mine.  He flung it down, and

says:



"Gimme a CASE-KNIFE."



I didn't know just what to do--but then I thought.  I scratched around

amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took

it and went to work, and never said a word.



He was always just that particular.  Full of principle.



So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and

made the fur fly.  We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long

as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it.

When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his

level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn't come it, his hands was

so sore.  At last he says:



"It ain't no use, it can't be done.  What you reckon I better do?  Can't

you think of no way?"



"Yes," I says, "but I reckon it ain't regular.  Come up the stairs, and

let on it's a lightning-rod."



So he done it.



Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house,

for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung

around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin

plates.  Tom says it wasn't enough; but I said nobody wouldn't ever see

the plates that Jim throwed out, because they'd fall in the dog-fennel

and jimpson weeds under the window-hole--then we could tote them back and

he could use them over again.  So Tom was satisfied.  Then he says:



"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim."



"Take them in through the hole," I says, "when we get it done."



He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard

of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying.  By and by he said

he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn't no need to decide

on any of them yet.  Said we'd got to post Jim first.



That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took

one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard

Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we

whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half

the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and

pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,

and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle

and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us

honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us

hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away,

and clearing out without losing any time.  But Tom he showed him how

unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and

how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not

to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, SURE.  So Jim

he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times

awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him

Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally

come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of

them was kind as they could be, Tom says:



"NOW I know how to fix it.  We'll send you some things by them."



I said, "Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass ideas

I ever struck;" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on.  It

was his way when he'd got his plans set.



So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other

large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the

lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we

would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them

out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her

apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and

what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with

his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see no

sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed

better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as

Tom said.



Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good

sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed,

with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high spirits.

He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most

intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep

it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out;

for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he

got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out to as

much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he said

it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it.



In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass

candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in

his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's

notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a

corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it

would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed

all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked better.

Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a

piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into bread,

you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his

fork into it in three or four places first.



And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a

couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim's bed; and they kept on

piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room in

there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to

door!  The nigger Nat he only just hollered "Witches" once, and keeled

over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was

dying.  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim's meat, and

the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back

again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.

Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and

asking him if he'd been imagining he saw something again.  He raised up,

and blinked his eyes around, and says:



"Mars Sid, you'll say I's a fool, but if I didn't b'lieve I see most a

million dogs, er devils, er some'n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese

tracks.  I did, mos' sholy.  Mars Sid, I FELT um--I FELT um, sah; dey was

all over me.  Dad fetch it, I jis' wisht I could git my han's on one er

dem witches jis' wunst--on'y jis' wunst--it's all I'd ast.  But mos'ly I

wisht dey'd lemme 'lone, I does."



Tom says:



"Well, I tell you what I think.  What makes them come here just at this

runaway nigger's breakfast-time?  It's because they're hungry; that's the

reason.  You make them a witch pie; that's the thing for YOU to do."



"But my lan', Mars Sid, how's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie?  I doan'

know how to make it.  I hain't ever hearn er sich a thing b'fo'."



"Well, then, I'll have to make it myself."



"Will you do it, honey?--will you?  I'll wusshup de groun' und' yo' foot,

I will!"



"All right, I'll do it, seeing it's you, and you've been good to us and

showed us the runaway nigger.  But you got to be mighty careful.  When we

come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we've put in the pan,

don't you let on you see it at all.  And don't you look when Jim unloads

the pan--something might happen, I don't know what.  And above all, don't

you HANDLE the witch-things."



"HANNEL 'm, Mars Sid?  What IS you a-talkin' 'bout?  I wouldn' lay de

weight er my finger on um, not f'r ten hund'd thous'n billion dollars, I

wouldn't."









CHAPTER XXXVII.



THAT was all fixed.  So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in

the back yard, where they keep the old boots, and rags, and pieces of

bottles, and wore-out tin things, and all such truck, and scratched

around and found an old tin washpan, and stopped up the holes as well as

we could, to bake the pie in, and took it down cellar and stole it full

of flour and started for breakfast, and found a couple of shingle-nails

that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and

sorrows on the dungeon walls with, and dropped one of them in Aunt

Sally's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair, and t'other we stuck

in the band of Uncle Silas's hat, which was on the bureau, because we

heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger's

house this morning, and then went to breakfast, and Tom dropped the

pewter spoon in Uncle Silas's coat-pocket, and Aunt Sally wasn't come

yet, so we had to wait a little while.



And when she come she was hot and red and cross, and couldn't hardly wait

for the blessing; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand

and cracking the handiest child's head with her thimble with the other,

and says:



"I've hunted high and I've hunted low, and it does beat all what HAS

become of your other shirt."



My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things, and a hard

piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the

road with a cough, and was shot across the table, and took one of the

children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm, and let a cry

out of him the size of a warwhoop, and Tom he turned kinder blue around

the gills, and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for

about a quarter of a minute or as much as that, and I would a sold out

for half price if there was a bidder.  But after that we was all right

again--it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold.

Uncle Silas he says:



"It's most uncommon curious, I can't understand it.  I know perfectly

well I took it OFF, because--"



"Because you hain't got but one ON.  Just LISTEN at the man!  I know you

took it off, and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory,

too, because it was on the clo's-line yesterday--I see it there myself.

But it's gone, that's the long and the short of it, and you'll just have

to change to a red flann'l one till I can get time to make a new one.

And it 'll be the third I've made in two years.  It just keeps a body on

the jump to keep you in shirts; and whatever you do manage to DO with 'm

all is more'n I can make out.  A body 'd think you WOULD learn to take

some sort of care of 'em at your time of life."



"I know it, Sally, and I do try all I can.  But it oughtn't to be

altogether my fault, because, you know, I don't see them nor have nothing

to do with them except when they're on me; and I don't believe I've ever

lost one of them OFF of me."



"Well, it ain't YOUR fault if you haven't, Silas; you'd a done it if you

could, I reckon.  And the shirt ain't all that's gone, nuther.  Ther's a

spoon gone; and THAT ain't all.  There was ten, and now ther's only nine.

The calf got the shirt, I reckon, but the calf never took the spoon,

THAT'S certain."



"Why, what else is gone, Sally?"



"Ther's six CANDLES gone--that's what.  The rats could a got the candles,

and I reckon they did; I wonder they don't walk off with the whole place,

the way you're always going to stop their holes and don't do it; and if

they warn't fools they'd sleep in your hair, Silas--YOU'D never find it

out; but you can't lay the SPOON on the rats, and that I know."



"Well, Sally, I'm in fault, and I acknowledge it; I've been remiss; but I

won't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes."



"Oh, I wouldn't hurry; next year 'll do.  Matilda Angelina Araminta

PHELPS!"



Whack comes the thimble, and the child snatches her claws out of the

sugar-bowl without fooling around any.  Just then the nigger woman steps

on to the passage, and says:



"Missus, dey's a sheet gone."



"A SHEET gone!  Well, for the land's sake!"



"I'll stop up them holes to-day," says Uncle Silas, looking sorrowful.



"Oh, DO shet up!--s'pose the rats took the SHEET?  WHERE'S it gone,

Lize?"



"Clah to goodness I hain't no notion, Miss' Sally.  She wuz on de

clo'sline yistiddy, but she done gone:  she ain' dah no mo' now."



"I reckon the world IS coming to an end.  I NEVER see the beat of it in

all my born days.  A shirt, and a sheet, and a spoon, and six can--"



"Missus," comes a young yaller wench, "dey's a brass cannelstick miss'n."



"Cler out from here, you hussy, er I'll take a skillet to ye!"



Well, she was just a-biling.  I begun to lay for a chance; I reckoned I

would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated.  She

kept a-raging right along, running her insurrection all by herself, and

everybody else mighty meek and quiet; and at last Uncle Silas, looking

kind of foolish, fishes up that spoon out of his pocket.  She stopped,

with her mouth open and her hands up; and as for me, I wished I was in

Jeruslem or somewheres. But not long, because she says:



"It's JUST as I expected.  So you had it in your pocket all the time; and

like as not you've got the other things there, too.  How'd it get there?"



"I reely don't know, Sally," he says, kind of apologizing, "or you know I

would tell.  I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before

breakfast, and I reckon I put it in there, not noticing, meaning to put

my Testament in, and it must be so, because my Testament ain't in; but

I'll go and see; and if the Testament is where I had it, I'll know I

didn't put it in, and that will show that I laid the Testament down and

took up the spoon, and--"



"Oh, for the land's sake!  Give a body a rest!  Go 'long now, the whole

kit and biling of ye; and don't come nigh me again till I've got back my

peace of mind."



I'd a heard her if she'd a said it to herself, let alone speaking it out;

and I'd a got up and obeyed her if I'd a been dead.  As we was passing

through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat, and the

shingle-nail fell out on the floor, and he just merely picked it up and

laid it on the mantel-shelf, and never said nothing, and went out.  Tom

see him do it, and remembered about the spoon, and says:



"Well, it ain't no use to send things by HIM no more, he ain't reliable."

Then he says:  "But he done us a good turn with the spoon, anyway,

without knowing it, and so we'll go and do him one without HIM knowing

it--stop up his rat-holes."



There was a noble good lot of them down cellar, and it took us a whole

hour, but we done the job tight and good and shipshape.  Then we heard

steps on the stairs, and blowed out our light and hid; and here comes the

old man, with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t'other,

looking as absent-minded as year before last.  He went a mooning around,

first to one rat-hole and then another, till he'd been to them all.  Then

he stood about five minutes, picking tallow-drip off of his candle and

thinking.  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs, saying:



"Well, for the life of me I can't remember when I done it.  I could show

her now that I warn't to blame on account of the rats.  But never mind

--let it go.  I reckon it wouldn't do no good."



And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs, and then we left.  He was a

mighty nice old man.  And always is.



Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon, but he said

we'd got to have it; so he took a think.  When he had ciphered it out he

told me how we was to do; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket

till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to counting the spoons

and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of them up my sleeve, and

Tom says:



"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons YET."



She says:



"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I counted 'm

myself."



"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine."



She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to count--anybody

would.



"I declare to gracious ther' AIN'T but nine!" she says.  "Why, what in

the world--plague TAKE the things, I'll count 'm again."



So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she

says:



"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's TEN now!" and she looked huffy and

bothered both.  But Tom says:



"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten."



"You numskull, didn't you see me COUNT 'm?"



"I know, but--"



"Well, I'll count 'm AGAIN."



So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.  Well,

she WAS in a tearing way--just a-trembling all over, she was so mad.  But

she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start to count in

the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they come out

right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed up the

basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west;

and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if we come

bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin us.  So we

had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was

a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along with her

shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with this

business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took, because

he said NOW she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save

her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if she DID; and

said that after she'd about counted her head off for the next three days

he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to

ever count them any more.



So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of her

closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of

days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more, and she

didn't CARE, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out

about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life; she druther

die first.



So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and

the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up

counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would

blow over by and by.



But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We fixed

it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it done at

last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we had to

use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and we got

burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with the smoke;

because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we couldn't

prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course we thought

of the right way at last--which was to cook the ladder, too, in the

pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore up the sheet

all in little strings and twisted them together, and long before daylight

we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with.  We let on it

took nine months to make it.



And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go into

the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope enough

for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over for soup, or

sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole dinner.



But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie,

and so we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the pies in the

wash-pan--afraid the solder would melt; but Uncle Silas he had a noble

brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of, because it belonged

to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from

England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early

ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things

that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they

warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked her

out, private, and took her down there, but she failed on the first pies,

because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last one.  We

took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and loaded her

up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the lid, and put

hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long handle, cool

and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a

satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would want to fetch a

couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope ladder wouldn't

cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm talking about,

and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time, too.



Nat didn't look when we put the witch pie in Jim's pan; and we put the

three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles; and so Jim

got everything all right, and as soon as he was by himself he busted into

the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick, and scratched

some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole.









CHAPTER XXXVIII.



MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job, and so was the saw; and Jim

allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all.  That's the

one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall.  But he had to have

it; Tom said he'd GOT to; there warn't no case of a state prisoner not

scrabbling his inscription to leave behind, and his coat of arms.



"Look at Lady Jane Grey," he says; "look at Gilford Dudley; look at old

Northumberland!  Why, Huck, s'pose it IS considerble trouble?--what you

going to do?--how you going to get around it?  Jim's GOT to do his

inscription and coat of arms.  They all do."



Jim says:



"Why, Mars Tom, I hain't got no coat o' arm; I hain't got nuffn but dish

yer ole shirt, en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat."



"Oh, you don't understand, Jim; a coat of arms is very different."



"Well," I says, "Jim's right, anyway, when he says he ain't got no coat

of arms, because he hain't."



"I reckon I knowed that," Tom says, "but you bet he'll have one before he

goes out of this--because he's going out RIGHT, and there ain't going to

be no flaws in his record."



So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece, Jim

a-making his'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon, Tom

set to work to think out the coat of arms.  By and by he said he'd struck

so many good ones he didn't hardly know which to take, but there was one

which he reckoned he'd decide on.  He says:



"On the scutcheon we'll have a bend OR in the dexter base, a saltire

MURREY in the fess, with a dog, couchant, for common charge, and under

his foot a chain embattled, for slavery, with a chevron VERT in a chief

engrailed, and three invected lines on a field AZURE, with the nombril

points rampant on a dancette indented; crest, a runaway nigger, SABLE,

with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister; and a couple of

gules for supporters, which is you and me; motto, MAGGIORE FRETTA, MINORE

OTTO.  Got it out of a book--means the more haste the less speed."



"Geewhillikins," I says, "but what does the rest of it mean?"



"We ain't got no time to bother over that," he says; "we got to dig in

like all git-out."



"Well, anyway," I says, "what's SOME of it?  What's a fess?"



"A fess--a fess is--YOU don't need to know what a fess is.  I'll show him

how to make it when he gets to it."



"Shucks, Tom," I says, "I think you might tell a person.  What's a bar

sinister?"



"Oh, I don't know.  But he's got to have it.  All the nobility does."



That was just his way.  If it didn't suit him to explain a thing to you,

he wouldn't do it.  You might pump at him a week, it wouldn't make no

difference.



He'd got all that coat of arms business fixed, so now he started in to

finish up the rest of that part of the work, which was to plan out a

mournful inscription--said Jim got to have one, like they all done.  He

made up a lot, and wrote them out on a paper, and read them off, so:



1.  Here a captive heart busted. 2.  Here a poor prisoner, forsook by the

world and friends, fretted his sorrowful life. 3.  Here a lonely heart

broke, and a worn spirit went to its rest, after thirty-seven years of

solitary captivity. 4.  Here, homeless and friendless, after thirty-seven

years of bitter captivity, perished a noble stranger, natural son of

Louis XIV.



Tom's voice trembled whilst he was reading them, and he most broke down.

When he got done he couldn't no way make up his mind which one for Jim to

scrabble on to the wall, they was all so good; but at last he allowed he

would let him scrabble them all on.  Jim said it would take him a year to

scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail, and he didn't

know how to make letters, besides; but Tom said he would block them out

for him, and then he wouldn't have nothing to do but just follow the

lines.  Then pretty soon he says:



"Come to think, the logs ain't a-going to do; they don't have log walls

in a dungeon:  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock.  We'll fetch a

rock."



Jim said the rock was worse than the logs; he said it would take him such

a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldn't ever get out.  But

Tom said he would let me help him do it.  Then he took a look to see how

me and Jim was getting along with the pens.  It was most pesky tedious

hard work and slow, and didn't give my hands no show to get well of the

sores, and we didn't seem to make no headway, hardly; so Tom says:



"I know how to fix it.  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and

mournful inscriptions, and we can kill two birds with that same rock.

There's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill, and we'll smouch it, and

carve the things on it, and file out the pens and the saw on it, too."



It warn't no slouch of an idea; and it warn't no slouch of a grindstone

nuther; but we allowed we'd tackle it.  It warn't quite midnight yet, so

we cleared out for the mill, leaving Jim at work.  We smouched the

grindstone, and set out to roll her home, but it was a most nation tough

job. Sometimes, do what we could, we couldn't keep her from falling over,

and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was going

to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half way; and

then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We see it

warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim So he raised up his bed and

slid the chain off of the bed-leg, and wrapt it round and round his neck,

and we crawled out through our hole and down there, and Jim and me laid

into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing; and Tom

superintended.  He could out-superintend any boy I ever see.  He knowed

how to do everything.



Our hole was pretty big, but it warn't big enough to get the grindstone

through; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough.  Then Tom

marked out them things on it with the nail, and set Jim to work on them,

with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the

lean-to for a hammer, and told him to work till the rest of his candle

quit on him, and then he could go to bed, and hide the grindstone under

his straw tick and sleep on it.  Then we helped him fix his chain back on

the bed-leg, and was ready for bed ourselves.  But Tom thought of

something, and says:



"You got any spiders in here, Jim?"



"No, sah, thanks to goodness I hain't, Mars Tom."



"All right, we'll get you some."



"But bless you, honey, I doan' WANT none.  I's afeard un um.  I jis' 's

soon have rattlesnakes aroun'."



Tom thought a minute or two, and says:



"It's a good idea.  And I reckon it's been done.  It MUST a been done; it

stands to reason.  Yes, it's a prime good idea.  Where could you keep

it?"



"Keep what, Mars Tom?"



"Why, a rattlesnake."



"De goodness gracious alive, Mars Tom!  Why, if dey was a rattlesnake to

come in heah I'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall, I would, wid

my head."



Why, Jim, you wouldn't be afraid of it after a little.  You could tame

it."



"TAME it!"



"Yes--easy enough.  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting,

and they wouldn't THINK of hurting a person that pets them.  Any book

will tell you that.  You try--that's all I ask; just try for two or three

days. Why, you can get him so in a little while that he'll love you; and

sleep with you; and won't stay away from you a minute; and will let you

wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth."



"PLEASE, Mars Tom--DOAN' talk so!  I can't STAN' it!  He'd LET me shove

his head in my mouf--fer a favor, hain't it?  I lay he'd wait a pow'ful

long time 'fo' I AST him.  En mo' en dat, I doan' WANT him to sleep wid

me."



"Jim, don't act so foolish.  A prisoner's GOT to have some kind of a dumb

pet, and if a rattlesnake hain't ever been tried, why, there's more glory

to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way

you could ever think of to save your life."



"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no sich glory.  Snake take 'n bite Jim's

chin off, den WHAH is de glory?  No, sah, I doan' want no sich doin's."



"Blame it, can't you TRY?  I only WANT you to try--you needn't keep it up

if it don't work."



"But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while I's a tryin' him.

Mars Tom, I's willin' to tackle mos' anything 'at ain't onreasonable, but

ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame, I's gwyne to

LEAVE, dat's SHORE."



"Well, then, let it go, let it go, if you're so bull-headed about it.  We

can get you some garter-snakes, and you can tie some buttons on their

tails, and let on they're rattlesnakes, and I reckon that 'll have to

do."



"I k'n stan' DEM, Mars Tom, but blame' 'f I couldn' get along widout um,

I tell you dat.  I never knowed b'fo' 't was so much bother and trouble

to be a prisoner."



"Well, it ALWAYS is when it's done right.  You got any rats around here?"



"No, sah, I hain't seed none."



"Well, we'll get you some rats."



"Why, Mars Tom, I doan' WANT no rats.  Dey's de dadblamedest creturs to

'sturb a body, en rustle roun' over 'im, en bite his feet, when he's

tryin' to sleep, I ever see.  No, sah, gimme g'yarter-snakes, 'f I's got

to have 'm, but doan' gimme no rats; I hain' got no use f'r um, skasely."



"But, Jim, you GOT to have 'em--they all do.  So don't make no more fuss

about it.  Prisoners ain't ever without rats.  There ain't no instance of

it.  And they train them, and pet them, and learn them tricks, and they

get to be as sociable as flies.  But you got to play music to them.  You

got anything to play music on?"



"I ain' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o' paper, en a juice-harp;

but I reck'n dey wouldn' take no stock in a juice-harp."



"Yes they would.  THEY don't care what kind of music 'tis.  A jews-harp's

plenty good enough for a rat.  All animals like music--in a prison they

dote on it.  Specially, painful music; and you can't get no other kind

out of a jews-harp.  It always interests them; they come out to see

what's the matter with you.  Yes, you're all right; you're fixed very

well.  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep, and

early in the mornings, and play your jews-harp; play 'The Last Link is

Broken'--that's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else;

and when you've played about two minutes you'll see all the rats, and the

snakes, and spiders, and things begin to feel worried about you, and

come.  And they'll just fairly swarm over you, and have a noble good

time."



"Yes, DEY will, I reck'n, Mars Tom, but what kine er time is JIM havin'?

Blest if I kin see de pint.  But I'll do it ef I got to.  I reck'n I

better keep de animals satisfied, en not have no trouble in de house."



Tom waited to think it over, and see if there wasn't nothing else; and

pretty soon he says:



"Oh, there's one thing I forgot.  Could you raise a flower here, do you

reckon?"



"I doan know but maybe I could, Mars Tom; but it's tolable dark in heah,

en I ain' got no use f'r no flower, nohow, en she'd be a pow'ful sight o'

trouble."



"Well, you try it, anyway.  Some other prisoners has done it."



"One er dem big cat-tail-lookin' mullen-stalks would grow in heah, Mars

Tom, I reck'n, but she wouldn't be wuth half de trouble she'd coss."



"Don't you believe it.  We'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in

the corner over there, and raise it.  And don't call it mullen, call it

Pitchiola--that's its right name when it's in a prison.  And you want to

water it with your tears."



"Why, I got plenty spring water, Mars Tom."



"You don't WANT spring water; you want to water it with your tears.  It's

the way they always do."



"Why, Mars Tom, I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid

spring water whiles another man's a START'N one wid tears."



"That ain't the idea.  You GOT to do it with tears."



"She'll die on my han's, Mars Tom, she sholy will; kase I doan' skasely

ever cry."



So Tom was stumped.  But he studied it over, and then said Jim would have

to worry along the best he could with an onion.  He promised he would go

to the nigger cabins and drop one, private, in Jim's coffee-pot, in the

morning. Jim said he would "jis' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee;"

and found so much fault with it, and with the work and bother of raising

the mullen, and jews-harping the rats, and petting and flattering up the

snakes and spiders and things, on top of all the other work he had to do

on pens, and inscriptions, and journals, and things, which made it more

trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he

ever undertook, that Tom most lost all patience with him; and said he was

just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in

the world to make a name for himself, and yet he didn't know enough to

appreciate them, and they was just about wasted on him.  So Jim he was

sorry, and said he wouldn't behave so no more, and then me and Tom shoved

for bed.









CHAPTER XXXIX.



IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and

fetched it down, and unstopped the best rat-hole, and in about an hour we

had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put it

in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.  But while we was gone for

spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found

it there, and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out,

and they did; and Aunt Sally she come in, and when we got back she was

a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what

they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted us

both with the hickry, and we was as much as two hours catching another

fifteen or sixteen, drat that meddlesome cub, and they warn't the

likeliest, nuther, because the first haul was the pick of the flock.

I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was.



We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and

caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's

nest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We didn't give it right

up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd

tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we

got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right

again, but couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,

and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in a

bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and a

rattling good honest day's work:  and hungry?--oh, no, I reckon not!  And

there warn't a blessed snake up there when we went back--we didn't half

tie the sack, and they worked out somehow, and left.  But it didn't

matter much, because they was still on the premises somewheres.  So we

judged we could get some of them again.  No, there warn't no real

scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell.  You'd see

them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then; and they

generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most of

the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome and

striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never

made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what

they might, and she couldn't stand them no way you could fix it; and

every time one of them flopped down on her, it didn't make no difference

what she was doing, she would just lay that work down and light out.  I

never see such a woman.  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho.  You

couldn't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs.  And if

she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a

howl that you would think the house was afire.  She disturbed the old man

so that he said he could most wish there hadn't ever been no snakes

created.  Why, after every last snake had been gone clear out of the

house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warn't over it yet; she warn't

near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could

touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right

out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all women was

just so.  He said they was made that way for some reason or other.



We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way, and she

allowed these lickings warn't nothing to what she would do if we ever

loaded up the place again with them.  I didn't mind the lickings, because

they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in

another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other things; and you

never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd all swarm out

for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders, and the spiders

didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it mighty warm for

him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone

there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and when there was, a body

couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was always lively, he said,

because THEY never all slept at one time, but took turn about, so when

the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and when the rats turned in

the snakes come on watch, so he always had one gang under him, in his

way, and t'other gang having a circus over him, and if he got up to hunt

a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over.

He said if he ever got out this time he wouldn't ever be a prisoner

again, not for a salary.



Well, by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape.  The

shirt was sent in early, in a pie, and every time a rat bit Jim he would

get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh; the

pens was made, the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the

grindstone; the bed-leg was sawed in two, and we had et up the sawdust,

and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache.  We reckoned we was all going

to die, but didn't.  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see; and

Tom said the same.  But as I was saying, we'd got all the work done now,

at last; and we was all pretty much fagged out, too, but mainly Jim.  The

old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to

come and get their runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because

there warn't no such plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in

the St. Louis and New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis

ones it give me the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose.

So Tom said, now for the nonnamous letters.



"What's them?"  I says.



"Warnings to the people that something is up.  Sometimes it's done one

way, sometimes another.  But there's always somebody spying around that

gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going to

light out of the Tooleries a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good way,

and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's usual

for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she stays in,

and he slides out in her clothes.  We'll do that, too."



"But looky here, Tom, what do we want to WARN anybody for that

something's up?  Let them find it out for themselves--it's their

lookout."



"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've acted

from the very start--left us to do EVERYTHING.  They're so confiding and

mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.  So if we don't

GIVE them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us,

and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off

perfectly flat; won't amount to nothing--won't be nothing TO it."



"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like."



"Shucks!" he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:



"But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits

me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?"



"You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that

yaller girl's frock."



"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she

prob'bly hain't got any but that one."



"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the

nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door."



"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my

own togs."



"You wouldn't look like a servant-girl THEN, would you?"



"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, ANYWAY."



"That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just to

do our DUTY, and not worry about whether anybody SEES us do it or not.

Hain't you got no principle at all?"



"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.  Who's Jim's

mother?"



"I'm his mother.  I'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally."



"Well, then, you'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves."



"Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed

to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's

gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When a

prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always called so

when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son; it

don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural one."



So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's

frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the

way Tom told me to.  It said:



Beware.  Trouble is brewing.  Keep a sharp lookout. UNKNOWN FRIEND.



Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and

crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on

the back door.  I never see a family in such a sweat.  They couldn't a

been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them

behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If a

door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said "ouch!" if anything fell, she

jumped and said "ouch!" if you happened to touch her, when she warn't

noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be satisfied,

because she allowed there was something behind her every time--so she was

always a-whirling around sudden, and saying "ouch," and before she'd got

two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it again; and she was

afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So the thing was working

very well, Tom said; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory.

He said it showed it was done right.



So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the

streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we

better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going to

have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the

lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,

and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back.  This letter said:



Don't betray me, I wish to be your friend.  There is a desprate gang of

cut-throats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway

nigger to-night, and they have been trying to scare you so as you will

stay in the house and not bother them.  I am one of the gang, but have

got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again, and will

betray the helish design. They will sneak down from northards, along the

fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the nigger's cabin

to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any

danger; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and

not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his chains loose, you slip

there and lock them in, and can kill them at your leasure.  Don't do

anything but just the way I am telling you; if you do they will suspicion

something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo. I do not wish any reward but to

know I have done the right thing. UNKNOWN FRIEND.









CHAPTER XL.



WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast, and took my canoe and went

over the river a-fishing, with a lunch, and had a good time, and took a

look at the raft and found her all right, and got home late to supper,

and found them in such a sweat and worry they didn't know which end they

was standing on, and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done

supper, and wouldn't tell us what the trouble was, and never let on a

word about the new letter, but didn't need to, because we knowed as much

about it as anybody did, and as soon as we was half up stairs and her

back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good

lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed, and got up about

half-past eleven, and Tom put on Aunt Sally's dress that he stole and

was going to start with the lunch, but says:



"Where's the butter?"



"I laid out a hunk of it," I says, "on a piece of a corn-pone."



"Well, you LEFT it laid out, then--it ain't here."



"We can get along without it," I says.



"We can get along WITH it, too," he says; "just you slide down cellar and

fetch it.  And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along.

I'll go and stuff the straw into Jim's clothes to represent his mother in

disguise, and be ready to BA like a sheep and shove soon as you get

there."



So out he went, and down cellar went I. The hunk of butter, big as a

person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of

corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very

stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt

Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my

hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:



"You been down cellar?"



"Yes'm."



"What you been doing down there?"



"Noth'n."



"NOTH'N!"



"No'm."



"Well, then, what possessed you to go down there this time of night?"



"I don't know 'm."



"You don't KNOW?  Don't answer me that way. Tom, I want to know what you

been DOING down there."



"I hain't been doing a single thing, Aunt Sally, I hope to gracious if I

have."



I reckoned she'd let me go now, and as a generl thing she would; but I

s'pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat

about every little thing that warn't yard-stick straight; so she says,

very decided:



"You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come.  You

been up to something you no business to, and I lay I'll find out what it

is before I'M done with you."



So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room.

My, but there was a crowd there!  Fifteen farmers, and every one of them

had a gun.  I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down.

They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice,

and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't;

but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and

putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats,

and fumbling with their buttons.  I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take

my hat off, all the same.



I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if

she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this

thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so we

could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before

these rips got out of patience and come for us.



At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I COULDN'T answer

them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men

was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay

for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight;

and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the

sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me

a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared;

and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt

and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of

them says, "I'M for going and getting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW,

and catching them when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter

come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns

white as a sheet, and says:



"For the land's sake, what IS the matter with the child?  He's got the

brain-fever as shore as you're born, and they're oozing out!"



And everybody runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out comes the

bread and what was left of the butter, and she grabbed me, and hugged me,

and says:



"Oh, what a turn you did give me! and how glad and grateful I am it ain't

no worse; for luck's against us, and it never rains but it pours, and

when I see that truck I thought we'd lost you, for I knowed by the color

and all it was just like your brains would be if--Dear, dear, whyd'nt you

TELL me that was what you'd been down there for, I wouldn't a cared.  Now

cler out to bed, and don't lemme see no more of you till morning!"



I was up stairs in a second, and down the lightning-rod in another one,

and shinning through the dark for the lean-to.  I couldn't hardly get my

words out, I was so anxious; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must

jump for it now, and not a minute to lose--the house full of men, yonder,

with guns!



His eyes just blazed; and he says:



"No!--is that so?  AIN'T it bully!  Why, Huck, if it was to do over

again, I bet I could fetch two hundred!  If we could put it off till--"



"Hurry!  HURRY!"  I says.  "Where's Jim?"



"Right at your elbow; if you reach out your arm you can touch him.  He's

dressed, and everything's ready.  Now we'll slide out and give the

sheep-signal."



But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door, and heard them

begin to fumble with the pad-lock, and heard a man say:



"I TOLD you we'd be too soon; they haven't come--the door is locked.

Here, I'll lock some of you into the cabin, and you lay for 'em in the

dark and kill 'em when they come; and the rest scatter around a piece,

and listen if you can hear 'em coming."



So in they come, but couldn't see us in the dark, and most trod on us

whilst we was hustling to get under the bed.  But we got under all right,

and out through the hole, swift but soft--Jim first, me next, and Tom

last, which was according to Tom's orders.  Now we was in the lean-to,

and heard trampings close by outside.  So we crept to the door, and Tom

stopped us there and put his eye to the crack, but couldn't make out

nothing, it was so dark; and whispered and said he would listen for the

steps to get further, and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first, and

him last.  So he set his ear to the crack and listened, and listened, and

listened, and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time; and at

last he nudged us, and we slid out, and stooped down, not breathing, and

not making the least noise, and slipped stealthy towards the fence in

Injun file, and got to it all right, and me and Jim over it; but Tom's

britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail, and then he hear the

steps coming, so he had to pull loose, which snapped the splinter and

made a noise; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings

out:



"Who's that?  Answer, or I'll shoot!"



But we didn't answer; we just unfurled our heels and shoved.  Then there

was a rush, and a BANG, BANG, BANG! and the bullets fairly whizzed around

us! We heard them sing out:



"Here they are!  They've broke for the river!  After 'em, boys, and turn

loose the dogs!"



So here they come, full tilt.  We could hear them because they wore boots

and yelled, but we didn't wear no boots and didn't yell.  We was in the

path to the mill; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into

the bush and let them go by, and then dropped in behind them.  They'd had

all the dogs shut up, so they wouldn't scare off the robbers; but by this

time somebody had let them loose, and here they come, making powwow

enough for a million; but they was our dogs; so we stopped in our tracks

till they catched up; and when they see it warn't nobody but us, and no

excitement to offer them, they only just said howdy, and tore right ahead

towards the shouting and clattering; and then we up-steam again, and

whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill, and then struck

up through the bush to where my canoe was tied, and hopped in and pulled

for dear life towards the middle of the river, but didn't make no more

noise than we was obleeged to. Then we struck out, easy and comfortable,

for the island where my raft was; and we could hear them yelling and

barking at each other all up and down the bank, till we was so far away

the sounds got dim and died out.  And when we stepped on to the raft I

says:



"NOW, old Jim, you're a free man again, and I bet you won't ever be a

slave no more."



"En a mighty good job it wuz, too, Huck.  It 'uz planned beautiful, en it

'uz done beautiful; en dey ain't NOBODY kin git up a plan dat's mo'

mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz."



We was all glad as we could be, but Tom was the gladdest of all because

he had a bullet in the calf of his leg.



When me and Jim heard that we didn't feel so brash as what we did before.

It was hurting him considerable, and bleeding; so we laid him in the

wigwam and tore up one of the duke's shirts for to bandage him, but he

says:



"Gimme the rags; I can do it myself.  Don't stop now; don't fool around

here, and the evasion booming along so handsome; man the sweeps, and set

her loose!  Boys, we done it elegant!--'deed we did.  I wish WE'D a had

the handling of Louis XVI., there wouldn't a been no 'Son of Saint Louis,

ascend to heaven!' wrote down in HIS biography; no, sir, we'd a whooped

him over the BORDER--that's what we'd a done with HIM--and done it just

as slick as nothing at all, too.  Man the sweeps--man the sweeps!"



But me and Jim was consulting--and thinking.  And after we'd thought a

minute, I says:



"Say it, Jim."



So he says:



"Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck.  Ef it wuz HIM dat 'uz

bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on

en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?'  Is dat like

Mars Tom Sawyer?  Would he say dat?  You BET he wouldn't!  WELL, den, is

JIM gywne to say it?  No, sah--I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout

a DOCTOR, not if it's forty year!"



I knowed he was white inside, and I reckoned he'd say what he did say--so

it was all right now, and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor.  He

raised considerable row about it, but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldn't

budge; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself; but

we wouldn't let him.  Then he give us a piece of his mind, but it didn't

do no good.



So when he sees me getting the canoe ready, he says:



"Well, then, if you re bound to go, I'll tell you the way to do when you

get to the village.  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and

fast, and make him swear to be silent as the grave, and put a purse full

of gold in his hand, and then take and lead him all around the back

alleys and everywheres in the dark, and then fetch him here in the canoe,

in a roundabout way amongst the islands, and search him and take his

chalk away from him, and don't give it back to him till you get him back

to the village, or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again.

It's the way they all do."



So I said I would, and left, and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see

the doctor coming till he was gone again.









CHAPTER XLI.



THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got

him up.  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting

yesterday afternoon, and camped on a piece of a raft we found, and about

midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams, for it went off and shot

him in the leg, and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say

nothing about it, nor let anybody know, because we wanted to come home

this evening and surprise the folks.



"Who is your folks?" he says.



"The Phelpses, down yonder."



"Oh," he says.  And after a minute, he says:



"How'd you say he got shot?"



"He had a dream," I says, "and it shot him."



"Singular dream," he says.



So he lit up his lantern, and got his saddle-bags, and we started.  But

when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of her--said she was big

enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:



"Oh, you needn't be afeard, sir, she carried the three of us easy

enough."



"What three?"



"Why, me and Sid, and--and--and THE GUNS; that's what I mean."



"Oh," he says.



But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her, and shook his head, and

said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was all

locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait till he

come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better go down home

and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But I said I didn't;

so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he started.



I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix that

leg just in three shakes of a sheep's tail, as the saying is? spos'n it

takes him three or four days?  What are we going to do?--lay around there

till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what I'LL do.  I'll

wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to go any more I'll get

down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie him, and keep him, and

shove out down the river; and when Tom's done with him we'll give him

what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him get ashore.



So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I

waked up the sun was away up over my head!  I shot out and went for the

doctor's house, but they told me he'd gone away in the night some time or

other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad for

Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved, and

turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's stomach!

He says:



"Why, TOM!  Where you been all this time, you rascal?"



"I hain't been nowheres," I says, "only just hunting for the runaway

nigger--me and Sid."



"Why, where ever did you go?" he says.  "Your aunt's been mighty uneasy."



"She needn't," I says, "because we was all right.  We followed the men

and the dogs, but they outrun us, and we lost them; but we thought we

heard them on the water, so we got a canoe and took out after them and

crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along

up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe

and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we

paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see

what he can hear, and I'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us,

and then we're going home."



So then we went to the post-office to get "Sid"; but just as I

suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the

office, and we waited awhile longer, but Sid didn't come; so the old man

said, come along, let Sid foot it home, or canoe it, when he got done

fooling around--but we would ride.  I couldn't get him to let me stay and

wait for Sid; and he said there warn't no use in it, and I must come

along, and let Aunt Sally see we was all right.



When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried

both, and hugged me, and give me one of them lickings of hern that don't

amount to shucks, and said she'd serve Sid the same when he come.



And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers' wives, to dinner; and

such another clack a body never heard.  Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst;

her tongue was a-going all the time.  She says:



"Well, Sister Phelps, I've ransacked that-air cabin over, an' I b'lieve

the nigger was crazy.  I says to Sister Damrell--didn't I, Sister

Damrell?--s'I, he's crazy, s'I--them's the very words I said.  You all

hearn me: he's crazy, s'I; everything shows it, s'I.  Look at that-air

grindstone, s'I; want to tell ME't any cretur 't's in his right mind 's a

goin' to scrabble all them crazy things onto a grindstone, s'I?  Here

sich 'n' sich a person busted his heart; 'n' here so 'n' so pegged along

for thirty-seven year, 'n' all that--natcherl son o' Louis somebody, 'n'

sich everlast'n rubbage.  He's plumb crazy, s'I; it's what I says in the

fust place, it's what I says in the middle, 'n' it's what I says last 'n'

all the time--the nigger's crazy--crazy 's Nebokoodneezer, s'I."



"An' look at that-air ladder made out'n rags, Sister Hotchkiss," says old

Mrs. Damrell; "what in the name o' goodness COULD he ever want of--"



"The very words I was a-sayin' no longer ago th'n this minute to Sister

Utterback, 'n' she'll tell you so herself.  Sh-she, look at that-air rag

ladder, sh-she; 'n' s'I, yes, LOOK at it, s'I--what COULD he a-wanted of

it, s'I.  Sh-she, Sister Hotchkiss, sh-she--"



"But how in the nation'd they ever GIT that grindstone IN there, ANYWAY?

'n' who dug that-air HOLE? 'n' who--"



"My very WORDS, Brer Penrod!  I was a-sayin'--pass that-air sasser o'

m'lasses, won't ye?--I was a-sayin' to Sister Dunlap, jist this minute,

how DID they git that grindstone in there, s'I.  Without HELP, mind you

--'thout HELP!  THAT'S wher 'tis.  Don't tell ME, s'I; there WUZ help,

s'I; 'n' ther' wuz a PLENTY help, too, s'I; ther's ben a DOZEN a-helpin'

that nigger, 'n' I lay I'd skin every last nigger on this place but I'D

find out who done it, s'I; 'n' moreover, s'I--"



"A DOZEN says you!--FORTY couldn't a done every thing that's been done.

Look at them case-knife saws and things, how tedious they've been made;

look at that bed-leg sawed off with 'm, a week's work for six men; look

at that nigger made out'n straw on the bed; and look at--"



"You may WELL say it, Brer Hightower!  It's jist as I was a-sayin' to

Brer Phelps, his own self.  S'e, what do YOU think of it, Sister

Hotchkiss, s'e? Think o' what, Brer Phelps, s'I?  Think o' that bed-leg

sawed off that a way, s'e?  THINK of it, s'I?  I lay it never sawed

ITSELF off, s'I--somebody SAWED it, s'I; that's my opinion, take it or

leave it, it mayn't be no 'count, s'I, but sich as 't is, it's my

opinion, s'I, 'n' if any body k'n start a better one, s'I, let him DO it,

s'I, that's all.  I says to Sister Dunlap, s'I--"



"Why, dog my cats, they must a ben a house-full o' niggers in there every

night for four weeks to a done all that work, Sister Phelps.  Look at

that shirt--every last inch of it kivered over with secret African writ'n

done with blood!  Must a ben a raft uv 'm at it right along, all the

time, amost.  Why, I'd give two dollars to have it read to me; 'n' as for

the niggers that wrote it, I 'low I'd take 'n' lash 'm t'll--"



"People to HELP him, Brother Marples!  Well, I reckon you'd THINK so if

you'd a been in this house for a while back.  Why, they've stole

everything they could lay their hands on--and we a-watching all the time,

mind you. They stole that shirt right off o' the line! and as for that

sheet they made the rag ladder out of, ther' ain't no telling how many

times they DIDN'T steal that; and flour, and candles, and candlesticks,

and spoons, and the old warming-pan, and most a thousand things that I

disremember now, and my new calico dress; and me and Silas and my Sid and

Tom on the constant watch day AND night, as I was a-telling you, and not

a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them; and

here at the last minute, lo and behold you, they slides right in under

our noses and fools us, and not only fools US but the Injun Territory

robbers too, and actuly gets AWAY with that nigger safe and sound, and

that with sixteen men and twenty-two dogs right on their very heels at

that very time!  I tell you, it just bangs anything I ever HEARD of.

Why, SPERITS couldn't a done better and been no smarter. And I reckon

they must a BEEN sperits--because, YOU know our dogs, and ther' ain't no

better; well, them dogs never even got on the TRACK of 'm once!  You

explain THAT to me if you can!--ANY of you!"



"Well, it does beat--"



"Laws alive, I never--"



"So help me, I wouldn't a be--"



"HOUSE-thieves as well as--"



"Goodnessgracioussakes, I'd a ben afeard to live in sich a--"



"'Fraid to LIVE!--why, I was that scared I dasn't hardly go to bed, or

get up, or lay down, or SET down, Sister Ridgeway.  Why, they'd steal the

very--why, goodness sakes, you can guess what kind of a fluster I was

in by the time midnight come last night.  I hope to gracious if I warn't

afraid they'd steal some o' the family!  I was just to that pass I didn't

have no reasoning faculties no more.  It looks foolish enough NOW, in the

daytime; but I says to myself, there's my two poor boys asleep, 'way up

stairs in that lonesome room, and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy

't I crep' up there and locked 'em in!  I DID.  And anybody would.

Because, you know, when you get scared that way, and it keeps running on,

and getting worse and worse all the time, and your wits gets to addling,

and you get to doing all sorts o' wild things, and by and by you think to

yourself, spos'n I was a boy, and was away up there, and the door ain't

locked, and you--" She stopped, looking kind of wondering, and then she

turned her head around slow, and when her eye lit on me--I got up and

took a walk.



Says I to myself, I can explain better how we come to not be in that room

this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little.  So I

done it.  But I dasn't go fur, or she'd a sent for me.  And when it was

late in the day the people all went, and then I come in and told her the

noise and shooting waked up me and "Sid," and the door was locked, and we

wanted to see the fun, so we went down the lightning-rod, and both of us

got hurt a little, and we didn't never want to try THAT no more.  And

then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before; and then

she said she'd forgive us, and maybe it was all right enough anyway, and

about what a body might expect of boys, for all boys was a pretty

harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see; and so, as long as no harm

hadn't come of it, she judged she better put in her time being grateful

we was alive and well and she had us still, stead of fretting over what

was past and done.  So then she kissed me, and patted me on the head, and

dropped into a kind of a brown study; and pretty soon jumps up, and says:



"Why, lawsamercy, it's most night, and Sid not come yet!  What HAS become

of that boy?"



I see my chance; so I skips up and says:



"I'll run right up to town and get him," I says.



"No you won't," she says.  "You'll stay right wher' you are; ONE'S enough

to be lost at a time.  If he ain't here to supper, your uncle 'll go."



Well, he warn't there to supper; so right after supper uncle went.



He come back about ten a little bit uneasy; hadn't run across Tom's

track. Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy; but Uncle Silas he said there

warn't no occasion to be--boys will be boys, he said, and you'll see this

one turn up in the morning all sound and right.  So she had to be

satisfied.  But she said she'd set up for him a while anyway, and keep a

light burning so he could see it.



And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her

candle, and tucked me in, and mothered me so good I felt mean, and like I

couldn't look her in the face; and she set down on the bed and talked

with me a long time, and said what a splendid boy Sid was, and didn't

seem to want to ever stop talking about him; and kept asking me every now

and then if I reckoned he could a got lost, or hurt, or maybe drownded,

and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead, and she

not by him to help him, and so the tears would drip down silent, and I

would tell her that Sid was all right, and would be home in the morning,

sure; and she would squeeze my hand, or maybe kiss me, and tell me to say

it again, and keep on saying it, because it done her good, and she was in

so much trouble.  And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes

so steady and gentle, and says:



"The door ain't going to be locked, Tom, and there's the window and the

rod; but you'll be good, WON'T you?  And you won't go?  For MY sake."



Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom, and was all

intending to go; but after that I wouldn't a went, not for kingdoms.



But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless.

And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around

front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her

eyes towards the road and the tears in them; and I wished I could do

something for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do

nothing to grieve her any more.  And the third time I waked up at dawn,

and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and

her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.









CHAPTER XLII.



THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn't get no track

of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying

nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not

eating anything. And by and by the old man says:



"Did I give you the letter?"



"What letter?"



"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office."



"No, you didn't give me no letter."



"Well, I must a forgot it."



So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had

laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her.  She says:



"Why, it's from St. Petersburg--it's from Sis."



I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn't stir.  But before

she could break it open she dropped it and run--for she see something.

And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and

Jim, in HER calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of

people.  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and

rushed.  She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says:



"Oh, he's dead, he's dead, I know he's dead!"



And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other,

which showed he warn't in his right mind; then she flung up her hands,

and says:



"He's alive, thank God!  And that's enough!" and she snatched a kiss of

him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders

right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue

could go, every jump of the way.



I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old

doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house.  The men was

very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the

other niggers around there, so they wouldn't be trying to run away like

Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family

scared most to death for days and nights.  But the others said, don't do

it, it wouldn't answer at all; he ain't our nigger, and his owner would

turn up and make us pay for him, sure.  So that cooled them down a

little, because the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a

nigger that hain't done just right is always the very ones that ain't the

most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of

him.



They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the

head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to

know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on

him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big

staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both

legs, and said he warn't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after

this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn't

come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a

couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every

night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time

they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl

good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and

says:



"Don't be no rougher on him than you're obleeged to, because he ain't a

bad nigger.  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn't cut the

bullet out without some help, and he warn't in no condition for me to

leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse,

and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn't let me come

a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he'd kill me, and no

end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn't do anything at

all with him; so I says, I got to have HELP somehow; and the minute I

says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he'll help, and

he done it, too, and done it very well.  Of course I judged he must be a

runaway nigger, and there I WAS! and there I had to stick right straight

along all the rest of the day and all night.  It was a fix, I tell you!

I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I'd of liked to

run up to town and see them, but I dasn't, because the nigger might get

away, and then I'd be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough

for me to hail.  So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this

morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller,

and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too,

and I see plain enough he'd been worked main hard lately.  I liked the

nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a

thousand dollars--and kind treatment, too.  I had everything I needed,

and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home--better,

maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I WAS, with both of 'm on my

hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some

men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was

setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so

I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and

tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble.

And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars

and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the

nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start.  He ain't

no bad nigger, gentlemen; that's what I think about him."



Somebody says:



"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I'm obleeged to say."



Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to

that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was

according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good

heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him.  Then they all

agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some

notice took of it, and reward.  So every one of them promised, right out

and hearty, that they wouldn't cuss him no more.



Then they come out and locked him up.  I hoped they was going to say he

could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten

heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they

didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but I

judged I'd get the doctor's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon

as I'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me

--explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot

when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling

around hunting the runaway nigger.



But I had plenty time.  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and

all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him.



Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally

was gone to get a nap.  So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him

awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash.

But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not

fire-faced the way he was when he come.  So I set down and laid for him

to wake.  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I

was, up a stump again!  She motioned me to be still, and set down by me,

and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all

the symptoms was first-rate, and he'd been sleeping like that for ever so

long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one

he'd wake up in his right mind.



So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his

eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says:



"Hello!--why, I'm at HOME!  How's that?  Where's the raft?"



"It's all right," I says.



"And JIM?"



"The same," I says, but couldn't say it pretty brash.  But he never

noticed, but says:



"Good!  Splendid!  NOW we're all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?"



I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says:  "About what, Sid?"



"Why, about the way the whole thing was done."



"What whole thing?"



"Why, THE whole thing.  There ain't but one; how we set the runaway

nigger free--me and Tom."



"Good land!  Set the run--What IS the child talking about!  Dear, dear,

out of his head again!"



"NO, I ain't out of my HEAD; I know all what I'm talking about.  We DID

set him free--me and Tom.  We laid out to do it, and we DONE it.  And we

done it elegant, too."  He'd got a start, and she never checked him up,

just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it

warn't no use for ME to put in.  "Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work

--weeks of it--hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep.

And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your

dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan,

and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can't

think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and

one thing or another, and you can't think HALF the fun it was.  And we

had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters

from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole

into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a

pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket--"



"Mercy sakes!"



"--and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for

Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that

you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we

was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive

at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go

by, and when the dogs come they warn't interested in us, but went for the

most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all

safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and WASN'T

it bully, Aunty!"



"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days!  So it was YOU,

you little rapscallions, that's been making all this trouble, and turned

everybody's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death.  I've

as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o' you this very

minute.  To think, here I've been, night after night, a--YOU just get

well once, you young scamp, and I lay I'll tan the Old Harry out o' both

o' ye!"



But Tom, he WAS so proud and joyful, he just COULDN'T hold in, and his

tongue just WENT it--she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and

both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says:



"WELL, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW, for mind I tell

you if I catch you meddling with him again--"



"Meddling with WHO?"  Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised.



"With WHO?  Why, the runaway nigger, of course.  Who'd you reckon?"



Tom looks at me very grave, and says:



"Tom, didn't you just tell me he was all right?  Hasn't he got away?"



"HIM?" says Aunt Sally; "the runaway nigger?  'Deed he hasn't.  They've

got him back, safe and sound, and he's in that cabin again, on bread and

water, and loaded down with chains, till he's claimed or sold!"



Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and

shutting like gills, and sings out to me:



"They hain't no RIGHT to shut him up!  SHOVE!--and don't you lose a

minute.  Turn him loose! he ain't no slave; he's as free as any cretur

that walks this earth!"



"What DOES the child mean?"



"I mean every word I SAY, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don't go, I'LL go.

I've knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there.  Old Miss Watson

died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him

down the river, and SAID so; and she set him free in her will."



"Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for, seeing he was

already free?"



"Well, that IS a question, I must say; and just like women!  Why, I

wanted the ADVENTURE of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood to

--goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!"



If she warn't standing right there, just inside the door, looking as

sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never!



Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried

over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it

was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  And I peeped out, and in

a little while Tom's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there

looking across at Tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding him into the

earth, you know.  And then she says:



"Yes, you BETTER turn y'r head away--I would if I was you, Tom."



"Oh, deary me!" says Aunt Sally; "IS he changed so?  Why, that ain't TOM,

it's Sid; Tom's--Tom's--why, where is Tom?  He was here a minute ago."



"You mean where's Huck FINN--that's what you mean!  I reckon I hain't

raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE

him.  That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do.  Come out from under that bed,

Huck Finn."



So I done it.  But not feeling brash.



Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see

--except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it

all to him.  It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn't

know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting

sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest

man in the world couldn't a understood it.  So Tom's Aunt Polly, she told

all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such

a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer--she chipped

in and says, "Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I'm used to it now, and

'tain't no need to change"--that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I

had to stand it--there warn't no other way, and I knowed he wouldn't

mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he'd make an

adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied.  And so it turned out,

and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me.



And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting

Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took

all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn't

ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he COULD

help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.



Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and

SID had come all right and safe, she says to herself:



"Look at that, now!  I might have expected it, letting him go off that

way without anybody to watch him.  So now I got to go and trapse all the

way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur's

up to THIS time, as long as I couldn't seem to get any answer out of you

about it."



"Why, I never heard nothing from you," says Aunt Sally.



"Well, I wonder!  Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean

by Sid being here."



"Well, I never got 'em, Sis."



Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:



"You, Tom!"



"Well--WHAT?" he says, kind of pettish.



"Don t you what ME, you impudent thing--hand out them letters."



"What letters?"



"THEM letters.  I be bound, if I have to take a-holt of you I'll--"



"They're in the trunk.  There, now.  And they're just the same as they

was when I got them out of the office.  I hain't looked into them, I

hain't touched them.  But I knowed they'd make trouble, and I thought if

you warn't in no hurry, I'd--"



"Well, you DO need skinning, there ain't no mistake about it.  And I

wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s'pose he--"



"No, it come yesterday; I hain't read it yet, but IT'S all right, I've

got that one."



I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn't, but I reckoned maybe it

was just as safe to not to.  So I never said nothing.









CHAPTER THE LAST



THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time

of the evasion?--what it was he'd planned to do if the evasion worked all

right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before?

And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got

Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and

have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about

his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and

pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the

niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight

procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would

we.  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was.



We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle

Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom,

they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him

all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  And we had him

up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars

for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim

was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:



"DAH, now, Huck, what I tell you?--what I tell you up dah on Jackson

islan'?  I TOLE you I got a hairy breas', en what's de sign un it; en I

TOLE you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich AGIN; en it's come

true; en heah she is!  DAH, now! doan' talk to ME--signs is SIGNS, mine I

tell you; en I knowed jis' 's well 'at I 'uz gwineter be rich agin as I's

a-stannin' heah dis minute!"



And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le's all three

slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for

howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a

couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain't

got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn't get none from

home, because it's likely pap's been back before now, and got it all away

from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up.



"No, he hain't," Tom says; "it's all there yet--six thousand dollars and

more; and your pap hain't ever been back since.  Hadn't when I come away,

anyhow."



Jim says, kind of solemn:



"He ain't a-comin' back no mo', Huck."



I says:



"Why, Jim?"



"Nemmine why, Huck--but he ain't comin' back no mo."



But I kept at him; so at last he says:



"Doan' you 'member de house dat was float'n down de river, en dey wuz a

man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn' let you

come in?  Well, den, you kin git yo' money when you wants it, kase dat

wuz him."



Tom's most well now, and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard

for a watch, and is always seeing what time it is, and so there ain't

nothing more to write about, and I am rotten glad of it, because if I'd a

knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldn't a tackled it, and

ain't a-going to no more.  But I reckon I got to light out for the

Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me

and sivilize me, and I can't stand it.  I been there before.

PREFACE



The ungentle laws and customs touched upon in this tale are

historical, and the episodes which are used to illustrate them

are also historical.  It is not pretended that these laws and

customs existed in England in the sixth century; no, it is only

pretended that inasmuch as they existed in the English and other

civilizations of far later times, it is safe to consider that it is

no libel upon the sixth century to suppose them to have been in

practice in that day also.  One is quite justified in inferring

that whatever one of these laws or customs was lacking in that

remote time, its place was competently filled by a worse one.



The question as to whether there is such a thing as divine right

of kings is not settled in this book.  It was found too difficult.

That the executive head of a nation should be a person of lofty

character and extraordinary ability, was manifest and indisputable;

that none but the Deity could select that head unerringly, was

also manifest and indisputable; that the Deity ought to make that

selection, then, was likewise manifest and indisputable; consequently,

that He does make it, as claimed, was an unavoidable deduction.

I mean, until the author of this book encountered the Pompadour,

and Lady Castlemaine, and some other executive heads of that kind;

these were found so difficult to work into the scheme, that it

was judged better to take the other tack in this book (which

must be issued this fall), and then go into training and settle

the question in another book.  It is, of course, a thing which

ought to be settled, and I am not going to have anything particular

to do next winter anyway.

A WORD OF EXPLANATION



It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger

whom I am going to talk about.  He attracted me by three things:

his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor,

and the restfulness of his company--for he did all the talking.

We fell together, as modest people will, in the tail of the herd

that was being shown through, and he at once began to say things

which interested me.  As he talked along, softly, pleasantly,

flowingly, he seemed to drift away imperceptibly out of this world

and time, and into some remote era and old forgotten country;

and so he gradually wove such a spell about me that I seemed

to move among the specters and shadows and dust and mold of a gray

antiquity, holding speech with a relic of it!  Exactly as I would

speak of my nearest personal friends or enemies, or my most familiar

neighbors, he spoke of Sir Bedivere, Sir Bors de Ganis, Sir Launcelot

of the Lake, Sir Galahad, and all the other great names of the

Table Round--and how old, old, unspeakably old and faded and dry

and musty and ancient he came to look as he went on!  Presently

he turned to me and said, just as one might speak of the weather,

or any other common matter--



"You know about transmigration of souls; do you know about

transposition of epochs--and bodies?"



I said I had not heard of it.  He was so little interested--just

as when people speak of the weather--that he did not notice

whether I made him any answer or not. There was half a moment

of silence, immediately interrupted by the droning voice of the

salaried cicerone:



"Ancient hauberk, date of the sixth century, time of King Arthur

and the Round Table; said to have belonged to the knight Sir Sagramor

le Desirous; observe the round hole through the chain-mail in

the left breast; can't be accounted for; supposed to have been

done with a bullet since invention of firearms--perhaps maliciously

by Cromwell's soldiers."



My acquaintance smiled--not a modern smile, but one that must

have gone out of general use many, many centuries ago--and muttered

apparently to himself:



"Wit ye well, _I saw it done_."  Then, after a pause, added:

"I did it myself."



By the time I had recovered from the electric surprise of this

remark, he was gone.



All that evening I sat by my fire at the Warwick Arms, steeped

in a dream of the olden time, while the rain beat upon the windows,

and the wind roared about the eaves and corners.  From time to

time I dipped into old Sir Thomas Malory's enchanting book, and

fed at its rich feast of prodigies and adventures, breathed in

the fragrance of its obsolete names, and dreamed again.  Midnight

being come at length, I read another tale, for a nightcap--this

which here follows, to wit:



HOW SIR LAUNCELOT SLEW TWO GIANTS, AND MADE A CASTLE FREE



   Anon withal came there upon him two great giants,

   well armed, all save the heads, with two horrible

   clubs in their hands.  Sir Launcelot put his shield

   afore him, and put the stroke away of the one

   giant, and with his sword he clave his head asunder.

   When his fellow saw that, he ran away as he were

   wood [*demented], for fear of the horrible strokes,

   and Sir Launcelot after him with all his might,

   and smote him on the shoulder, and clave him to

   the middle.  Then Sir Launcelot went into the hall,

   and there came afore him three score ladies and

   damsels, and all kneeled unto him, and thanked

   God and him of their deliverance.  For, sir, said

   they, the most part of us have been here this

   seven year their prisoners, and we have worked all

   manner of silk works for our meat, and we are all

   great gentle-women born, and blessed be the time,

   knight, that ever thou wert born; for thou hast

   done the most worship that ever did knight in the

   world, that will we bear record, and we all pray

   you to tell us your name, that we may tell our

   friends who delivered us out of prison.  Fair

   damsels, he said, my name is Sir Launcelot du

   Lake.  And so he departed from them and betaught

   them unto God.  And then he mounted upon his

   horse, and rode into many strange and wild

   countries, and through many waters and valleys,

   and evil was he lodged.  And at the last by

   fortune him happened against a night to come to

   a fair courtilage, and therein he found an old

   gentle-woman that lodged him with a good-will,

   and there he had good cheer for him and his horse.

   And when time was, his host brought him into a

   fair garret over the gate to his bed. There

   Sir Launcelot unarmed him, and set his harness

   by him, and went to bed, and anon he fell on

   sleep. So, soon after there came one on

   horseback, and knocked at the gate in great

   haste.  And when Sir Launcelot heard this he rose

   up, and looked out at the window, and saw by the

   moonlight three knights come riding after that

   one man, and all three lashed on him at once

   with swords, and that one knight turned on them

   knightly again and defended him. Truly, said

   Sir Launcelot, yonder one knight shall I help,

   for it were shame for me to see three knights

   on one, and if he be slain I am partner of his

   death.  And therewith he took his harness and

   went out at a window by a sheet down to the four

   knights, and then Sir Launcelot said on high,

   Turn you knights unto me, and leave your

   fighting with that knight. And then they all

   three left Sir Kay, and turned unto Sir Launcelot,

   and there began great battle, for they alight

   all three, and strake many strokes at Sir

   Launcelot, and assailed him on every side. Then

   Sir Kay dressed him for to have holpen Sir

   Launcelot.  Nay, sir, said he, I will none of

   your help, therefore as ye will have my help

   let me alone with them.  Sir Kay for the pleasure

   of the knight suffered him for to do his will,

   and so stood aside. And then anon within six

   strokes Sir Launcelot had stricken them to the earth.



   And then they all three cried, Sir Knight, we

   yield us unto you as man of might matchless.  As

   to that, said Sir Launcelot, I will not take

   your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield

   you unto Sir Kay the seneschal, on that covenant

   I will save your lives and else not.  Fair knight,

   said they, that were we loath to do; for as for

   Sir Kay we chased him hither, and had overcome

   him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto

   him it were no reason.  Well, as to that, said

   Sir Launcelot, advise you well, for ye may

   choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be

   yielden, it shall be unto Sir Kay.  Fair knight,

   then they said, in saving our lives we will do

   as thou commandest us.  Then shall ye, said Sir

   Launcelot, on Whitsunday next coming go unto the

   court of King Arthur, and there shall ye yield

   you unto Queen Guenever, and put you all three

   in her grace and mercy, and say that Sir Kay

   sent you thither to be her prisoners.  On the morn

   Sir Launcelot arose early, and left Sir Kay

   sleeping; and Sir Launcelot took Sir Kay's armor

   and his shield and armed him, and so he went to

   the stable and took his horse, and took his leave

   of his host, and so he departed.  Then soon after

   arose Sir Kay and missed Sir Launcelot; and

   then he espied that he had his armor and his

   horse. Now by my faith I know well that he will

   grieve some of the court of King Arthur; for on

   him knights will be bold, and deem that it is I,

   and that will beguile them; and because of his

   armor and shield I am sure I shall ride in peace.

   And then soon after departed Sir Kay, and

   thanked his host.





As I laid the book down there was a knock at the door, and my

stranger came in.  I gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him

welcome.  I also comforted him with a hot Scotch whisky; gave him

another one; then still another--hoping always for his story.

After a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quite

simple and natural way:







THE STRANGER'S HISTORY



I am an American.  I was born and reared in Hartford, in the State

of Connecticut--anyway, just over the river, in the country.  So

I am a Yankee of the Yankees--and practical; yes, and nearly

barren of sentiment, I suppose--or poetry, in other words.  My

father was a blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and I was

both, along at first.  Then I went over to the great arms factory

and learned my real trade; learned all there was to it; learned

to make everything: guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all

sorts of labor-saving machinery.  Why, I could make anything

a body wanted--anything in the world, it didn't make any difference

what; and if there wasn't any quick new-fangled way to make a thing,

I could invent one--and do it as easy as rolling off a log.  I became

head superintendent; had a couple of thousand men under me.



Well, a man like that is a man that is full of fight--that goes

without saying.  With a couple of thousand rough men under one,

one has plenty of that sort of amusement.  I had, anyway.  At last

I met my match, and I got my dose.  It was during a misunderstanding

conducted with crowbars with a fellow we used to call Hercules.

He laid me out with a crusher alongside the head that made everything

crack, and seemed to spring every joint in my skull and made it

overlap its neighbor.  Then the world went out in darkness, and

I didn't feel anything more, and didn't know anything at all

--at least for a while.



When I came to again, I was sitting under an oak tree, on the

grass, with a whole beautiful and broad country landscape all

to myself--nearly.  Not entirely; for there was a fellow on a horse,

looking down at me--a fellow fresh out of a picture-book.  He was

in old-time iron armor from head to heel, with a helmet on his

head the shape of a nail-keg with slits in it; and he had a shield,

and a sword, and a prodigious spear; and his horse had armor on,

too, and a steel horn projecting from his forehead, and gorgeous

red and green silk trappings that hung down all around him like

a bedquilt, nearly to the ground.



"Fair sir, will ye just?" said this fellow.



"Will I which?"



"Will ye try a passage of arms for land or lady or for--"



"What are you giving me?" I said.  "Get along back to your circus,

or I'll report you."



Now what does this man do but fall back a couple of hundred yards

and then come rushing at me as hard as he could tear, with his

nail-keg bent down nearly to his horse's neck and his long spear

pointed straight ahead.  I saw he meant business, so I was up

the tree when he arrived.



He allowed that I was his property, the captive of his spear.

There was argument on his side--and the bulk of the advantage

--so I judged it best to humor him.  We fixed up an agreement

whereby I was to go with him and he was not to hurt me.  I came

down, and we started away, I walking by the side of his horse.

We marched comfortably along, through glades and over brooks which

I could not remember to have seen before--which puzzled me and

made me wonder--and yet we did not come to any circus or sign of

a circus.  So I gave up the idea of a circus, and concluded he was

from an asylum.  But we never came to an asylum--so I was up

a stump, as you may say.  I asked him how far we were from Hartford.

He said he had never heard of the place; which I took to be a lie,

but allowed it to go at that.  At the end of an hour we saw a

far-away town sleeping in a valley by a winding river; and beyond

it on a hill, a vast gray fortress, with towers and turrets,

the first I had ever seen out of a picture.



"Bridgeport?" said I, pointing.



"Camelot," said he.





My stranger had been showing signs of sleepiness.  He caught

himself nodding, now, and smiled one of those pathetic, obsolete

smiles of his, and said:



"I find I can't go on; but come with me, I've got it all written

out, and you can read it if you like."



In his chamber, he said: "First, I kept a journal; then by and by,

after years, I took the journal and turned it into a book. How

long ago that was!"



He handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where

I should begin:



"Begin here--I've already told you what goes before."  He was

steeped in drowsiness by this time.  As I went out at his door

I heard him murmur sleepily: "Give you good den, fair sir."



I sat down by my fire and examined my treasure.  The first part

of it--the great bulk of it--was parchment, and yellow with age.

I scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest.

Under the old dim writing of the Yankee historian appeared traces

of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still--Latin words

and sentences: fragments from old monkish legends, evidently.

I turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read

--as follows:









THE TALE OF THE LOST LAND









CHAPTER I



CAMELOT



"Camelot--Camelot," said I to myself.  "I don't seem to remember

hearing of it before.  Name of the asylum, likely."



It was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream,

and as lonesome as Sunday.  The air was full of the smell of

flowers, and the buzzing of insects, and the twittering of birds,

and there were no people, no wagons, there was no stir of life,

nothing going on.  The road was mainly a winding path with hoof-prints

in it, and now and then a faint trace of wheels on either side in

the grass--wheels that apparently had a tire as broad as one's hand.



Presently a fair slip of a girl, about ten years old, with a cataract

of golden hair streaming down over her shoulders, came along.

Around her head she wore a hoop of flame-red poppies. It was as

sweet an outfit as ever I saw, what there was of it.  She walked

indolently along, with a mind at rest, its peace reflected in her

innocent face.  The circus man paid no attention to her; didn't

even seem to see her.  And she--she was no more startled at his

fantastic make-up than if she was used to his like every day of

her life.  She was going by as indifferently as she might have gone

by a couple of cows; but when she happened to notice me, _then_

there was a change!  Up went her hands, and she was turned to stone;

her mouth dropped open, her eyes stared wide and timorously, she

was the picture of astonished curiosity touched with fear.  And

there she stood gazing, in a sort of stupefied fascination, till

we turned a corner of the wood and were lost to her view.  That

she should be startled at me instead of at the other man, was too

many for me; I couldn't make head or tail of it.  And that she

should seem to consider me a spectacle, and totally overlook her

own merits in that respect, was another puzzling thing, and a

display of magnanimity, too, that was surprising in one so young.

There was food for thought here.  I moved along as one in a dream.



As we approached the town, signs of life began to appear.  At

intervals we passed a wretched cabin, with a thatched roof, and

about it small fields and garden patches in an indifferent state of

cultivation.  There were people, too; brawny men, with long, coarse,

uncombed hair that hung down over their faces and made them look

like animals.  They and the women, as a rule, wore a coarse

tow-linen robe that came well below the knee, and a rude sort of

sandal, and many wore an iron collar.  The small boys and girls

were always naked; but nobody seemed to know it.  All of these

people stared at me, talked about me, ran into the huts and fetched

out their families to gape at me; but nobody ever noticed that

other fellow, except to make him humble salutation and get no

response for their pains.



In the town were some substantial windowless houses of stone

scattered among a wilderness of thatched cabins; the streets were

mere crooked alleys, and unpaved; troops of dogs and nude children

played in the sun and made life and noise; hogs roamed and rooted

contentedly about, and one of them lay in a reeking wallow in

the middle of the main thoroughfare and suckled her family.

Presently there was a distant blare of military music; it came

nearer, still nearer, and soon a noble cavalcade wound into view,

glorious with plumed helmets and flashing mail and flaunting banners

and rich doublets and horse-cloths and gilded spearheads; and

through the muck and swine, and naked brats, and joyous dogs, and

shabby huts, it took its gallant way, and in its wake we followed.

Followed through one winding alley and then another,--and climbing,

always climbing--till at last we gained the breezy height where

the huge castle stood.  There was an exchange of bugle blasts;

then a parley from the walls, where men-at-arms, in hauberk and

morion, marched back and forth with halberd at shoulder under

flapping banners with the rude figure of a dragon displayed upon

them; and then the great gates were flung open, the drawbridge

was lowered, and the head of the cavalcade swept forward under

the frowning arches; and we, following, soon found ourselves in

a great paved court, with towers and turrets stretching up into

the blue air on all the four sides; and all about us the dismount

was going on, and much greeting and ceremony, and running to and

fro, and a gay display of moving and intermingling colors, and

an altogether pleasant stir and noise and confusion.







CHAPTER II



KING ARTHUR'S COURT



The moment I got a chance I slipped aside privately and touched

an ancient common looking man on the shoulder and said, in an

insinuating, confidential way:



"Friend, do me a kindness.  Do you belong to the asylum, or are

you just on a visit or something like that?"



He looked me over stupidly, and said:



"Marry, fair sir, me seemeth--"



"That will do," I said; "I reckon you are a patient."



I moved away, cogitating, and at the same time keeping an eye

out for any chance passenger in his right mind that might come

along and give me some light.  I judged I had found one, presently;

so I drew him aside and said in his ear:



"If I could see the head keeper a minute--only just a minute--"



"Prithee do not let me."



"Let you _what_?"



"_Hinder_ me, then, if the word please thee better.  Then he went

on to say he was an under-cook and could not stop to gossip,

though he would like it another time; for it would comfort his

very liver to know where I got my clothes.  As he started away he

pointed and said yonder was one who was idle enough for my purpose,

and was seeking me besides, no doubt.  This was an airy slim boy

in shrimp-colored tights that made him look like a forked carrot,

the rest of his gear was blue silk and dainty laces and ruffles;

and he had long yellow curls, and wore a plumed pink satin cap

tilted complacently over his ear.  By his look, he was good-natured;

by his gait, he was satisfied with himself.  He was pretty enough

to frame.  He arrived, looked me over with a smiling and impudent

curiosity; said he had come for me, and informed me that he was a page.



"Go 'long," I said; "you ain't more than a paragraph."



It was pretty severe, but I was nettled.  However, it never phazed

him; he didn't appear to know he was hurt.  He began to talk and

laugh, in happy, thoughtless, boyish fashion, as we walked along,

and made himself old friends with me at once; asked me all sorts

of questions about myself and about my clothes, but never waited

for an answer--always chattered straight ahead, as if he didn't

know he had asked a question and wasn't expecting any reply, until

at last he happened to mention that he was born in the beginning

of the year 513.



It made the cold chills creep over me!  I stopped and said,

a little faintly:



"Maybe I didn't hear you just right.  Say it again--and say it

slow.  What year was it?"



"513."



"513!  You don't look it!  Come, my boy, I am a stranger and

friendless; be honest and honorable with me.  Are you in your

right mind?"



He said he was.



"Are these other people in their right minds?"



He said they were.



"And this isn't an asylum?  I mean, it isn't a place where they

cure crazy people?"



He said it wasn't.



"Well, then," I said, "either I am a lunatic, or something just

as awful has happened.  Now tell me, honest and true, where am I?"



"IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT."



I waited a minute, to let that idea shudder its way home,

and then said:



"And according to your notions, what year is it now?"



"528--nineteenth of June."



I felt a mournful sinking at the heart, and muttered: "I shall

never see my friends again--never, never again.  They will not

be born for more than thirteen hundred years yet."



I seemed to believe the boy, I didn't know why.  _Something_ in me

seemed to believe him--my consciousness, as you may say; but my

reason didn't.  My reason straightway began to clamor; that was

natural.  I didn't know how to go about satisfying it, because

I knew that the testimony of men wouldn't serve--my reason would

say they were lunatics, and throw out their evidence.  But all

of a sudden I stumbled on the very thing, just by luck.  I knew

that the only total eclipse of the sun in the first half of the

sixth century occurred on the 21st of June, A.D. 528, O.S., and

began at 3 minutes after 12 noon.  I also knew that no total eclipse

of the sun was due in what to _me_ was the present year--i.e., 1879.

So, if I could keep my anxiety and curiosity from eating the heart

out of me for forty-eight hours, I should then find out for certain

whether this boy was telling me the truth or not.



Wherefore, being a practical Connecticut man, I now shoved this

whole problem clear out of my mind till its appointed day and hour

should come, in order that I might turn all my attention to the

circumstances of the present moment, and be alert and ready to

make the most out of them that could be made.  One thing at a time,

is my motto--and just play that thing for all it is worth, even

if it's only two pair and a jack.  I made up my mind to two things:

if it was still the nineteenth century and I was among lunatics

and couldn't get away, I would presently boss that asylum or know

the reason why; and if, on the other hand, it was really the sixth

century, all right, I didn't want any softer thing: I would boss

the whole country inside of three months; for I judged I would

have the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matter

of thirteen hundred years and upward.  I'm not a man to waste

time after my mind's made up and there's work on hand; so I said

to the page:



"Now, Clarence, my boy--if that might happen to be your name

--I'll get you to post me up a little if you don't mind.  What is

the name of that apparition that brought me here?"



"My master and thine?  That is the good knight and great lord

Sir Kay the Seneschal, foster brother to our liege the king."



"Very good; go on, tell me everything."



He made a long story of it; but the part that had immediate interest

for me was this: He said I was Sir Kay's prisoner, and that

in the due course of custom I would be flung into a dungeon and

left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me--unless

I chanced to rot, first.  I saw that the last chance had the best

show, but I didn't waste any bother about that; time was too

precious.  The page said, further, that dinner was about ended

in the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociability

and the heavy drinking should begin, Sir Kay would have me in and

exhibit me before King Arthur and his illustrious knights seated at

the Table Round, and would brag about his exploit in capturing

me, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but it

wouldn't be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe,

either; and when I was done being exhibited, then ho for the

dungeon; but he, Clarence, would find a way to come and see me every

now and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends.



Get word to my friends!  I thanked him; I couldn't do less; and

about this time a lackey came to say I was wanted; so Clarence

led me in and took me off to one side and sat down by me.



Well, it was a curious kind of spectacle, and interesting. It was

an immense place, and rather naked--yes, and full of loud contrasts.

It was very, very lofty; so lofty that the banners depending from

the arched beams and girders away up there floated in a sort of

twilight; there was a stone-railed gallery at each end, high up,

with musicians in the one, and women, clothed in stunning colors,

in the other.  The floor was of big stone flags laid in black and

white squares, rather battered by age and use, and needing repair.

As to ornament, there wasn't any, strictly speaking; though on

the walls hung some huge tapestries which were probably taxed

as works of art; battle-pieces, they were, with horses shaped like

those which children cut out of paper or create in gingerbread;

with men on them in scale armor whose scales are represented by

round holes--so that the man's coat looks as if it had been done

with a biscuit-punch.  There was a fireplace big enough to camp in;

and its projecting sides and hood, of carved and pillared stonework,

had the look of a cathedral door.  Along the walls stood men-at-arms,

in breastplate and morion, with halberds for their only weapon

--rigid as statues; and that is what they looked like.



In the middle of this groined and vaulted public square was an oaken

table which they called the Table Round.  It was as large as

a circus ring; and around it sat a great company of men dressed

in such various and splendid colors that it hurt one's eyes to look

at them.  They wore their plumed hats, right along, except that

whenever one addressed himself directly to the king, he lifted

his hat a trifle just as he was beginning his remark.



Mainly they were drinking--from entire ox horns; but a few were

still munching bread or gnawing beef bones.  There was about

an average of two dogs to one man; and these sat in expectant

attitudes till a spent bone was flung to them, and then they went

for it by brigades and divisions, with a rush, and there ensued

a fight which filled the prospect with a tumultuous chaos of

plunging heads and bodies and flashing tails, and the storm of

howlings and barkings deafened all speech for the time; but that

was no matter, for the dog-fight was always a bigger interest

anyway; the men rose, sometimes, to observe it the better and bet

on it, and the ladies and the musicians stretched themselves out

over their balusters with the same object; and all broke into

delighted ejaculations from time to time. In the end, the winning

dog stretched himself out comfortably with his bone between his

paws, and proceeded to growl over it, and gnaw it, and grease

the floor with it, just as fifty others were already doing; and the

rest of the court resumed their previous industries and entertainments.



As a rule, the speech and behavior of these people were gracious

and courtly; and I noticed that they were good and serious listeners

when anybody was telling anything--I mean in a dog-fightless

interval.  And plainly, too, they were a childlike and innocent lot;

telling lies of the stateliest pattern with a most gentle and

winning naivety, and ready and willing to listen to anybody else's

lie, and believe it, too.  It was hard to associate them with

anything cruel or dreadful; and yet they dealt in tales of blood

and suffering with a guileless relish that made me almost forget

to shudder.



I was not the only prisoner present.  There were twenty or more.

Poor devils, many of them were maimed, hacked, carved, in a frightful

way; and their hair, their faces, their clothing, were caked with

black and stiffened drenchings of blood.  They were suffering

sharp physical pain, of course; and weariness, and hunger and

thirst, no doubt; and at least none had given them the comfort

of a wash, or even the poor charity of a lotion for their wounds;

yet you never heard them utter a moan or a groan, or saw them show

any sign of restlessness, or any disposition to complain.  The

thought was forced upon me: "The rascals--_they_ have served other

people so in their day; it being their own turn, now, they were

not expecting any better treatment than this; so their philosophical

bearing is not an outcome of mental training, intellectual fortitude,

reasoning; it is mere animal training; they are white Indians."







CHAPTER III



KNIGHTS OF THE TABLE ROUND



Mainly the Round Table talk was monologues--narrative accounts

of the adventures in which these prisoners were captured and their

friends and backers killed and stripped of their steeds and armor.

As a general thing--as far as I could make out--these murderous

adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to

settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were

simply duels between strangers--duels between people who had never

even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no

cause of offense whatever.  Many a time I had seen a couple of boys,

strangers, meet by chance, and say simultaneously, "I can lick you,"

and go at it on the spot; but I had always imagined until now that

that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and

mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it

and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond.  Yet there

was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted

creatures, something attractive and lovable.  There did not seem

to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait

a fish-hook with; but you didn't seem to mind that, after a little,

because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society

like that, and indeed would have marred it, hindered it, spoiled

its symmetry--perhaps rendered its existence impossible.



There was a fine manliness observable in almost every face; and

in some a certain loftiness and sweetness that rebuked your

belittling criticisms and stilled them.  A most noble benignity

and purity reposed in the countenance of him they called Sir Galahad,

and likewise in the king's also; and there was majesty and greatness

in the giant frame and high bearing of Sir Launcelot of the Lake.



There was presently an incident which centered the general interest

upon this Sir Launcelot.  At a sign from a sort of master of

ceremonies, six or eight of the prisoners rose and came forward

in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward

the ladies' gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.

The most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed

of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent,

and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his

fellows into her hands for free pardon, ransom, captivity, or death,

as she in her good pleasure might elect; and this, as he said, he

was doing by command of Sir Kay the Seneschal, whose prisoners

they were, he having vanquished them by his single might and

prowess in sturdy conflict in the field.



Surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over

the house; the queen's gratified smile faded out at the name of

Sir Kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered in

my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision--



"Sir _Kay_, forsooth!  Oh, call me pet names, dearest, call me

a marine!  In twice a thousand years shall the unholy invention

of man labor at odds to beget the fellow to this majestic lie!"



Every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon Sir Kay. But he

was equal to the occasion.  He got up and played his hand like

a major--and took every trick.  He said he would state the case

exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple

straightforward tale, without comment of his own; "and then,"

said he, "if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him

who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or

strake with sword in the ranks of Christian battle--even him that

sitteth there!" and he pointed to Sir Launcelot.  Ah, he fetched

them; it was a rattling good stroke.  Then he went on and told

how Sir Launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by,

killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred

and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still

seeking adventures, and found him (Sir Kay) fighting a desperate

fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle

solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night

Sir Launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in Sir Kay's armor and

took Sir Kay's horse and gat him away into distant lands, and

vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four

in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear

that about Whitsuntide they would ride to Arthur's court and yield

them to Queen Guenever's hands as captives of Sir Kay the Seneschal,

spoil of his knightly prowess; and now here were these half dozen,

and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of

their desperate wounds.



Well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look

embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at Sir Launcelot

that would have got him shot in Arkansas, to a dead certainty.



Everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of Sir Launcelot; and

as for me, I was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself,

should have been able to beat down and capture such battalions

of practiced fighters.  I said as much to Clarence; but this mocking

featherhead only said:



"An Sir Kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him,

ye had seen the accompt doubled."



I looked at the boy in sorrow; and as I looked I saw the cloud of

a deep despondency settle upon his countenance.  I followed the

direction of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-bearded

man, clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standing

at the table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancient

head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye.

The same suffering look that was in the page's face was observable

in all the faces around--the look of dumb creatures who know that

they must endure and make no moan.



"Marry, we shall have it again," sighed the boy; "that same old

weary tale that he hath told a thousand times in the same words,

and that he _will_ tell till he dieth, every time he hath gotten his

barrel full and feeleth his exaggeration-mill a-working.  Would

God I had died or I saw this day!"



"Who is it?"



"Merlin, the mighty liar and magician, perdition singe him for

the weariness he worketh with his one tale!  But that men fear

him for that he hath the storms and the lightnings and all the

devils that be in hell at his beck and call, they would have dug

his entrails out these many years ago to get at that tale and

squelch it.  He telleth it always in the third person, making

believe he is too modest to glorify himself--maledictions light

upon him, misfortune be his dole!  Good friend, prithee call me

for evensong."



The boy nestled himself upon my shoulder and pretended to go

to sleep.  The old man began his tale; and presently the lad was

asleep in reality; so also were the dogs, and the court, the lackeys,

and the files of men-at-arms.  The droning voice droned on; a soft

snoring arose on all sides and supported it like a deep and subdued

accompaniment of wind instruments.  Some heads were bowed upon

folded arms, some lay back with open mouths that issued unconscious

music; the flies buzzed and bit, unmolested, the rats swarmed

softly out from a hundred holes, and pattered about, and made

themselves at home everywhere; and one of them sat up like a

squirrel on the king's head and held a bit of cheese in its hands

and nibbled it, and dribbled the crumbs in the king's face with

naive and impudent irreverence.  It was a tranquil scene, and

restful to the weary eye and the jaded spirit.



This was the old man's tale.  He said:



"Right so the king and Merlin departed, and went until an hermit

that was a good man and a great leech.  So the hermit searched

all his wounds and gave him good salves; so the king was there

three days, and then were his wounds well amended that he might

ride and go, and so departed.  And as they rode, Arthur said,

I have no sword.  No force* [*Footnote from M.T.: No matter.],

said Merlin, hereby is a sword that shall be yours and I may.

So they rode till they came to a lake, the which was a fair water

and broad, and in the midst of the lake Arthur was ware of an arm

clothed in white samite, that held a fair sword in that hand.

Lo, said Merlin, yonder is that sword that I spake of.  With that

they saw a damsel going upon the lake.  What damsel is that?

said Arthur.  That is the Lady of the lake, said Merlin; and within

that lake is a rock, and therein is as fair a place as any on earth,

and richly beseen, and this damsel will come to you anon, and then

speak ye fair to her that she will give you that sword.  Anon

withal came the damsel unto Arthur and saluted him, and he her

again.  Damsel, said Arthur, what sword is that, that yonder

the arm holdeth above the water?  I would it were mine, for I have

no sword.  Sir Arthur King, said the damsel, that sword is mine,

and if ye will give me a gift when I ask it you, ye shall have it.

By my faith, said Arthur, I will give you what gift ye will ask.

Well, said the damsel, go ye into yonder barge and row yourself

to the sword, and take it and the scabbard with you, and I will ask

my gift when I see my time.  So Sir Arthur and Merlin alight, and

tied their horses to two trees, and so they went into the ship,

and when they came to the sword that the hand held, Sir Arthur

took it up by the handles, and took it with him.  And the arm

and the hand went under the water; and so they came unto the land

and rode forth.  And then Sir Arthur saw a rich pavilion.  What

signifieth yonder pavilion?  It is the knight's pavilion, said

Merlin, that ye fought with last, Sir Pellinore, but he is out,

he is not there; he hath ado with a knight of yours, that hight

Egglame, and they have fought together, but at the last Egglame

fled, and else he had been dead, and he hath chased him even

to Carlion, and we shall meet with him anon in the highway.  That

is well said, said Arthur, now have I a sword, now will I wage

battle with him, and be avenged on him.  Sir, ye shall not so,

said Merlin, for the knight is weary of fighting and chasing, so

that ye shall have no worship to have ado with him; also, he will

not lightly be matched of one knight living; and therefore it is my

counsel, let him pass, for he shall do you good service in short

time, and his sons, after his days.  Also ye shall see that day

in short space ye shall be right glad to give him your sister

to wed.  When I see him, I will do as ye advise me, said Arthur.

Then Sir Arthur looked on the sword, and liked it passing well.

Whether liketh you better, said Merlin, the sword or the scabbard?

Me liketh better the sword, said Arthur.  Ye are more unwise,

said Merlin, for the scabbard is worth ten of the sword, for while

ye have the scabbard upon you ye shall never lose no blood, be ye

never so sore wounded; therefore, keep well the scabbard always

with you.  So they rode into Carlion, and by the way they met with

Sir Pellinore; but Merlin had done such a craft that Pellinore saw

not Arthur, and he passed by without any words.  I marvel, said

Arthur, that the knight would not speak.  Sir, said Merlin, he saw

you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.  So

they came unto Carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.

And when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would

jeopard his person so alone.  But all men of worship said it was

merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in

adventure as other poor knights did."







CHAPTER IV



SIR DINADAN THE HUMORIST



It seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully

told; but then I had heard it only once, and that makes a difference;

it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt.



Sir Dinadan the Humorist was the first to awake, and he soon roused

the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality.

He tied some metal mugs to a dog's tail and turned him loose,

and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright,

with all the other dogs bellowing after him and battering and

crashing against everything that came in their way and making

altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and

turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed

till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and

wallowed on the floor in ecstasy.  It was just like so many children.

Sir Dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep

from telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal

idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humorists

of his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else had

got through.  He was so set up that he concluded to make a speech

--of course a humorous speech.  I think I never heard so many old

played-out jokes strung together in my life.  He was worse than

the minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus.  It seemed

peculiarly sad to sit here, thirteen hundred years before I was

born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had

given me the dry gripes when I was a boy thirteen hundred years

afterwards.  It about convinced me that there isn't any such thing

as a new joke possible.  Everybody laughed at these antiquities

--but then they always do; I had noticed that, centuries later.

However, of course the scoffer didn't laugh--I mean the boy.  No,

he scoffed; there wasn't anything he wouldn't scoff at. He said

the most of Sir Dinadan's jokes were rotten and the rest were

petrified.  I said "petrified" was good; as I believed, myself,

that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of

those jokes was by geologic periods.  But that neat idea hit

the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn't been invented yet.

However, I made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate

the commonwealth up to it if I pulled through.  It is no use

to throw a good thing away merely because the market isn't ripe yet.



Now Sir Kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me

for fuel.  It was time for me to feel serious, and I did.  Sir Kay

told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who

all wore the same ridiculous garb that I did--a garb that was a work

of enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt

by human hands.  However he had nullified the force of the

enchantment by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights in

a three hours' battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my life

in order that so strange a curiosity as I was might be exhibited

to the wonder and admiration of the king and the court.  He spoke

of me all the time, in the blandest way, as "this prodigious giant,"

and "this horrible sky-towering monster," and "this tusked and

taloned man-devouring ogre", and everybody took in all this bosh

in the naivest way, and never smiled or seemed to notice that

there was any discrepancy between these watered statistics and me.

He said that in trying to escape from him I sprang into the top of

a tree two hundred cubits high at a single bound, but he dislodged

me with a stone the size of a cow, which "all-to brast" the most

of my bones, and then swore me to appear at Arthur's court for

sentence.  He ended by condemning me to die at noon on the 21st;

and was so little concerned about it that he stopped to yawn before

he named the date.



I was in a dismal state by this time; indeed, I was hardly enough

in my right mind to keep the run of a dispute that sprung up as

to how I had better be killed, the possibility of the killing being

doubted by some, because of the enchantment in my clothes. And yet

it was nothing but an ordinary suit of fifteen-dollar slop-shops.

Still, I was sane enough to notice this detail, to wit: many of

the terms used in the most matter-of-fact way by this great

assemblage of the first ladies and gentlemen in the land would

have made a Comanche blush.  Indelicacy is too mild a term to convey

the idea.  However, I had read "Tom Jones," and "Roderick Random,"

and other books of that kind, and knew that the highest and first

ladies and gentlemen in England had remained little or no cleaner

in their talk, and in the morals and conduct which such talk

implies, clear up to a hundred years ago; in fact clear into our

own nineteenth century--in which century, broadly speaking,

the earliest samples of the real lady and real gentleman discoverable

in English history--or in European history, for that matter--may be

said to have made their appearance.  Suppose Sir Walter, instead

of putting the conversations into the mouths of his characters,

had allowed the characters to speak for themselves?  We should

have had talk from Rebecca and Ivanhoe and the soft lady Rowena

which would embarrass a tramp in our day.  However, to the

unconsciously indelicate all things are delicate.  King Arthur's

people were not aware that they were indecent and I had presence

of mind enough not to mention it.



They were so troubled about my enchanted clothes that they were

mightily relieved, at last, when old Merlin swept the difficulty

away for them with a common-sense hint.  He asked them why they

were so dull--why didn't it occur to them to strip me.  In half a

minute I was as naked as a pair of tongs!  And dear, dear, to think

of it: I was the only embarrassed person there.  Everybody discussed

me; and did it as unconcernedly as if I had been a cabbage.

Queen Guenever was as naively interested as the rest, and said

she had never seen anybody with legs just like mine before.  It was

the only compliment I got--if it was a compliment.



Finally I was carried off in one direction, and my perilous clothes

in another.  I was shoved into a dark and narrow cell in a dungeon,

with some scant remnants for dinner, some moldy straw for a bed,

and no end of rats for company.







CHAPTER V



AN INSPIRATION



I was so tired that even my fears were not able to keep me awake long.



When I next came to myself, I seemed to have been asleep a very

long time.  My first thought was, "Well, what an astonishing dream

I've had!  I reckon I've waked only just in time to keep from

being hanged or drowned or burned or something....  I'll nap again

till the whistle blows, and then I'll go down to the arms factory

and have it out with Hercules."



But just then I heard the harsh music of rusty chains and bolts,

a light flashed in my eyes, and that butterfly, Clarence, stood

before me!  I gasped with surprise; my breath almost got away from me.



"What!" I said, "you here yet?  Go along with the rest of

the dream! scatter!"



But he only laughed, in his light-hearted way, and fell to making

fun of my sorry plight.



"All right," I said resignedly, "let the dream go on; I'm in no hurry."



"Prithee what dream?"



"What dream?  Why, the dream that I am in Arthur's court--a person

who never existed; and that I am talking to you, who are nothing

but a work of the imagination."



"Oh, la, indeed! and is it a dream that you're to be burned

to-morrow?  Ho-ho--answer me that!"



The shock that went through me was distressing.  I now began

to reason that my situation was in the last degree serious, dream

or no dream; for I knew by past experience of the lifelike intensity

of dreams, that to be burned to death, even in a dream, would be

very far from being a jest, and was a thing to be avoided, by any

means, fair or foul, that I could contrive.  So I said beseechingly:



"Ah, Clarence, good boy, only friend I've got,--for you _are_ my

friend, aren't you?--don't fail me; help me to devise some way

of escaping from this place!"



"Now do but hear thyself!  Escape?  Why, man, the corridors are

in guard and keep of men-at-arms."



"No doubt, no doubt.  But how many, Clarence?  Not many, I hope?"



"Full a score.  One may not hope to escape."  After a pause

--hesitatingly: "and there be other reasons--and weightier."



"Other ones? What are they?"



"Well, they say--oh, but I daren't, indeed daren't!"



"Why, poor lad, what is the matter?  Why do you blench?  Why do

you tremble so?"



"Oh, in sooth, there is need!  I do want to tell you, but--"



"Come, come, be brave, be a man--speak out, there's a good lad!"



He hesitated, pulled one way by desire, the other way by fear;

then he stole to the door and peeped out, listening; and finally

crept close to me and put his mouth to my ear and told me his

fearful news in a whisper, and with all the cowering apprehension

of one who was venturing upon awful ground and speaking of things

whose very mention might be freighted with death.



"Merlin, in his malice, has woven a spell about this dungeon, and

there bides not the man in these kingdoms that would be desperate

enough to essay to cross its lines with you!  Now God pity me,

I have told it!  Ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who

means thee well; for an thou betray me I am lost!"



I laughed the only really refreshing laugh I had had for some time;

and shouted:



"Merlin has wrought a spell!  _Merlin_, forsooth!  That cheap old

humbug, that maundering old ass?  Bosh, pure bosh, the silliest bosh

in the world!  Why, it does seem to me that of all the childish,

idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev

--oh, damn Merlin!"



But Clarence had slumped to his knees before I had half finished,

and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.



"Oh, beware!  These are awful words!  Any moment these walls

may crumble upon us if you say such things.  Oh call them back

before it is too late!"



Now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to

thinking.  If everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely

afraid of Merlin's pretended magic as Clarence was, certainly

a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to contrive

some way to take advantage of such a state of things.  I went

on thinking, and worked out a plan. Then I said:



"Get up.  Pull yourself together; look me in the eye.  Do you

know why I laughed?"



"No--but for our blessed Lady's sake, do it no more."



"Well, I'll tell you why I laughed.  Because I'm a magician myself."



"Thou!"  The boy recoiled a step, and caught his breath, for

the thing hit him rather sudden; but the aspect which he took

on was very, very respectful.  I took quick note of that; it

indicated that a humbug didn't need to have a reputation in this

asylum; people stood ready to take him at his word, without that.

I resumed.



"I've know Merlin seven hundred years, and he--"



"Seven hun--"



"Don't interrupt me.  He has died and come alive again thirteen

times, and traveled under a new name every time: Smith, Jones,

Robinson, Jackson, Peters, Haskins, Merlin--a new alias every

time he turns up.  I knew him in Egypt three hundred years ago;

I knew him in India five hundred years ago--he is always blethering

around in my way, everywhere I go; he makes me tired.  He don't

amount to shucks, as a magician; knows some of the old common

tricks, but has never got beyond the rudiments, and never will.

He is well enough for the provinces--one-night stands and that

sort of thing, you know--but dear me, _he_ oughtn't to set up for

an expert--anyway not where there's a real artist.  Now look here,

Clarence, I am going to stand your friend, right along, and in

return you must be mine.  I want you to do me a favor.  I want

you to get word to the king that I am a magician myself--and the

Supreme Grand High-yu-Muck-amuck and head of the tribe, at that;

and I want him to be made to understand that I am just quietly

arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these

realms if Sir Kay's project is carried out and any harm comes

to me.  Will you get that to the king for me?"



The poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me.

It was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so

demoralized.  But he promised everything; and on my side he made

me promise over and over again that I would remain his friend, and

never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him. Then

he worked his way out, staying himself with his hand along the

wall, like a sick person.



Presently this thought occurred to me: how heedless I have been!

When the boy gets calm, he will wonder why a great magician like me

should have begged a boy like him to help me get out of this place;

he will put this and that together, and will see that I am a humbug.



I worried over that heedless blunder for an hour, and called myself

a great many hard names, meantime.  But finally it occurred to me

all of a sudden that these animals didn't reason; that _they_ never

put this and that together; that all their talk showed that they

didn't know a discrepancy when they saw it.  I was at rest, then.



But as soon as one is at rest, in this world, off he goes on

something else to worry about.  It occurred to me that I had made

another blunder: I had sent the boy off to alarm his betters with

a threat--I intending to invent a calamity at my leisure; now

the people who are the readiest and eagerest and willingest to

swallow miracles are the very ones who are hungriest to see you

perform them; suppose I should be called on for a sample?  Suppose

I should be asked to name my calamity?  Yes, I had made a blunder;

I ought to have invented my calamity first.  "What shall I do?

what can I say, to gain a little time?"  I was in trouble again;

in the deepest kind of trouble...



"There's a footstep!--they're coming.  If I had only just a moment

to think....  Good, I've got it.  I'm all right."



You see, it was the eclipse.  It came into my mind in the nick

of time, how Columbus, or Cortez, or one of those people, played

an eclipse as a saving trump once, on some savages, and I saw my

chance.  I could play it myself, now, and it wouldn't be any

plagiarism, either, because I should get it in nearly a thousand

years ahead of those parties.



Clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:



"I hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he

had me to his presence.  He was frighted even to the marrow,

and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement, and

that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so

great; but then came Merlin and spoiled all; for he persuaded

the king that you are mad, and know not whereof you speak; and

said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing.  They

disputed long, but in the end, Merlin, scoffing, said, 'Wherefore

hath he not _named_ his brave calamity?  Verily it is because he

cannot.'  This thrust did in a most sudden sort close the king's

mouth, and he could offer naught to turn the argument; and so,

reluctant, and full loth to do you the discourtesy, he yet prayeth

you to consider his perplexed case, as noting how the matter stands,

and name the calamity--if so be you have determined the nature

of it and the time of its coming.  Oh, prithee delay not; to delay

at such a time were to double and treble the perils that already

compass thee about.  Oh, be thou wise--name the calamity!"



I allowed silence to accumulate while I got my impressiveness

together, and then said:



"How long have I been shut up in this hole?"



"Ye were shut up when yesterday was well spent.  It is 9 of

the morning now."



"No!  Then I have slept well, sure enough.  Nine in the morning

now!  And yet it is the very complexion of midnight, to a shade.

This is the 20th, then?"



"The 20th--yes."



"And I am to be burned alive to-morrow."  The boy shuddered.



"At what hour?"



"At high noon."



"Now then, I will tell you what to say."  I paused, and stood over

that cowering lad a whole minute in awful silence; then, in a voice

deep, measured, charged with doom, I began, and rose by dramatically

graded stages to my colossal climax, which I delivered in as sublime

and noble a way as ever I did such a thing in my life: "Go back

and tell the king that at that hour I will smother the whole world

in the dead blackness of midnight; I will blot out the sun, and he

shall never shine again; the fruits of the earth shall rot for lack

of light and warmth, and the peoples of the earth shall famish

and die, to the last man!"



I had to carry the boy out myself, he sunk into such a collapse.

I handed him over to the soldiers, and went back.







CHAPTER VI



THE ECLIPSE



In the stillness and the darkness, realization soon began to

supplement knowledge.  The mere knowledge of a fact is pale; but

when you come to _realize_ your fact, it takes on color. It is

all the difference between hearing of a man being stabbed to

the heart, and seeing it done.  In the stillness and the darkness,

the knowledge that I was in deadly danger took to itself deeper

and deeper meaning all the time; a something which was realization

crept inch by inch through my veins and turned me cold.



But it is a blessed provision of nature that at times like these,

as soon as a man's mercury has got down to a certain point there

comes a revulsion, and he rallies.  Hope springs up, and cheerfulness

along with it, and then he is in good shape to do something for

himself, if anything can be done.  When my rally came, it came with

a bound.  I said to myself that my eclipse would be sure to save me,

and make me the greatest man in the kingdom besides; and straightway

my mercury went up to the top of the tube, and my solicitudes

all vanished.  I was as happy a man as there was in the world.

I was even impatient for to-morrow to come, I so wanted to gather

in that great triumph and be the center of all the nation's wonder

and reverence.  Besides, in a business way it would be the making

of me; I knew that.



Meantime there was one thing which had got pushed into the background

of my mind.  That was the half-conviction that when the nature

of my proposed calamity should be reported to those superstitious

people, it would have such an effect that they would want to

compromise.  So, by and by when I heard footsteps coming, that

thought was recalled to me, and I said to myself, "As sure as

anything, it's the compromise.  Well, if it is good, all right,

I will accept; but if it isn't, I mean to stand my ground and play

my hand for all it is worth."



The door opened, and some men-at-arms appeared.  The leader said:



"The stake is ready. Come!"



The stake!  The strength went out of me, and I almost fell down.

It is hard to get one's breath at such a time, such lumps come into

one's throat, and such gaspings; but as soon as I could speak, I said:



"But this is a mistake--the execution is to-morrow."



"Order changed; been set forward a day.  Haste thee!"



I was lost.  There was no help for me.  I was dazed, stupefied;

I had no command over myself, I only wandered purposely about,

like one out of his mind; so the soldiers took hold of me, and

pulled me along with them, out of the cell and along the maze of

underground corridors, and finally into the fierce glare of daylight

and the upper world.  As we stepped into the vast enclosed court

of the castle I got a shock; for the first thing I saw was the stake,

standing in the center, and near it the piled fagots and a monk.

On all four sides of the court the seated multitudes rose rank

above rank, forming sloping terraces that were rich with color.

The king and the queen sat in their thrones, the most conspicuous

figures there, of course.



To note all this, occupied but a second.  The next second Clarence

had slipped from some place of concealment and was pouring news

into my ear, his eyes beaming with triumph and gladness.  He said:



"Tis through _me_ the change was wrought!  And main hard have I worked

to do it, too.  But when I revealed to them the calamity in store,

and saw how mighty was the terror it did engender, then saw I also

that this was the time to strike!  Wherefore I diligently pretended,

unto this and that and the other one, that your power against the sun

could not reach its full until the morrow; and so if any would save

the sun and the world, you must be slain to-day, while your

enchantments are but in the weaving and lack potency.  Odsbodikins,

it was but a dull lie, a most indifferent invention, but you should

have seen them seize it and swallow it, in the frenzy of their

fright, as it were salvation sent from heaven; and all the while

was I laughing in my sleeve the one moment, to see them so cheaply

deceived, and glorifying God the next, that He was content to let

the meanest of His creatures be His instrument to the saving of

thy life.  Ah how happy has the matter sped!  You will not need

to do the sun a _real_ hurt--ah, forget not that, on your soul forget

it not!  Only make a little darkness--only the littlest little

darkness, mind, and cease with that.  It will be sufficient.  They

will see that I spoke falsely,--being ignorant, as they will fancy

--and with the falling of the first shadow of that darkness you

shall see them go mad with fear; and they will set you free and

make you great!  Go to thy triumph, now!  But remember--ah, good

friend, I implore thee remember my supplication, and do the blessed

sun no hurt.  For _my_ sake, thy true friend."



I choked out some words through my grief and misery; as much as

to say I would spare the sun; for which the lad's eyes paid me back

with such deep and loving gratitude that I had not the heart

to tell him his good-hearted foolishness had ruined me and sent me

to my death.



As the soldiers assisted me across the court the stillness was

so profound that if I had been blindfold I should have supposed

I was in a solitude instead of walled in by four thousand people.

There was not a movement perceptible in those masses of humanity;

they were as rigid as stone images, and as pale; and dread sat

upon every countenance.  This hush continued while I was being

chained to the stake; it still continued while the fagots were

carefully and tediously piled about my ankles, my knees, my thighs,

my body.  Then there was a pause, and a deeper hush, if possible,

and a man knelt down at my feet with a blazing torch; the multitude

strained forward, gazing, and parting slightly from their seats

without knowing it; the monk raised his hands above my head, and

his eyes toward the blue sky, and began some words in Latin; in

this attitude he droned on and on, a little while, and then stopped.

I waited two or three moments; then looked up; he was standing

there petrified.  With a common impulse the multitude rose slowly

up and stared into the sky.  I followed their eyes, as sure as guns,

there was my eclipse beginning!  The life went boiling through

my veins; I was a new man!  The rim of black spread slowly into

the sun's disk, my heart beat higher and higher, and still the

assemblage and the priest stared into the sky, motionless.  I knew

that this gaze would be turned upon me, next.  When it was, I was

ready.  I was in one of the most grand attitudes I ever struck,

with my arm stretched up pointing to the sun.  It was a noble

effect.  You could _see_ the shudder sweep the mass like a wave.

Two shouts rang out, one close upon the heels of the other:



"Apply the torch!"



"I forbid it!"



The one was from Merlin, the other from the king.  Merlin started

from his place--to apply the torch himself, I judged.  I said:



"Stay where you are.  If any man moves--even the king--before

I give him leave, I will blast him with thunder, I will consume

him with lightnings!"



The multitude sank meekly into their seats, and I was just expecting

they would.  Merlin hesitated a moment or two, and I was on pins

and needles during that little while.  Then he sat down, and I took

a good breath; for I knew I was master of the situation now.

The king said:



"Be merciful, fair sir, and essay no further in this perilous matter,

lest disaster follow.  It was reported to us that your powers could

not attain unto their full strength until the morrow; but--"



"Your Majesty thinks the report may have been a lie?  It _was_ a lie."



That made an immense effect; up went appealing hands everywhere,

and the king was assailed with a storm of supplications that

I might be bought off at any price, and the calamity stayed.

The king was eager to comply. He said:



"Name any terms, reverend sir, even to the halving of my kingdom;

but banish this calamity, spare the sun!"



My fortune was made.  I would have taken him up in a minute, but

I couldn't stop an eclipse; the thing was out of the question.  So

I asked time to consider.  The king said:



"How long--ah, how long, good sir?  Be merciful; look, it groweth

darker, moment by moment.  Prithee how long?"



"Not long.  Half an hour--maybe an hour."



There were a thousand pathetic protests, but I couldn't shorten up

any, for I couldn't remember how long a total eclipse lasts.  I was

in a puzzled condition, anyway, and wanted to think.  Something

was wrong about that eclipse, and the fact was very unsettling.

If this wasn't the one I was after, how was I to tell whether this

was the sixth century, or nothing but a dream?  Dear me, if I could

only prove it was the latter!  Here was a glad new hope.  If the boy

was right about the date, and this was surely the 20th, it _wasn't_

the sixth century.  I reached for the monk's sleeve, in considerable

excitement, and asked him what day of the month it was.



Hang him, he said it was the _twenty-first_!  It made me turn cold

to hear him.  I begged him not to make any mistake about it; but

he was sure; he knew it was the 21st.  So, that feather-headed

boy had botched things again!  The time of the day was right

for the eclipse; I had seen that for myself, in the beginning,

by the dial that was near by.  Yes, I was in King Arthur's court,

and I might as well make the most out of it I could.



The darkness was steadily growing, the people becoming more and

more distressed.  I now said:



"I have reflected, Sir King.  For a lesson, I will let this darkness

proceed, and spread night in the world; but whether I blot out

the sun for good, or restore it, shall rest with you.  These are

the terms, to wit: You shall remain king over all your dominions,

and receive all the glories and honors that belong to the kingship;

but you shall appoint me your perpetual minister and executive,

and give me for my services one per cent of such actual increase

of revenue over and above its present amount as I may succeed

in creating for the state.  If I can't live on that, I sha'n't ask

anybody to give me a lift.  Is it satisfactory?"



There was a prodigious roar of applause, and out of the midst

of it the king's voice rose, saying:



"Away with his bonds, and set him free! and do him homage, high

and low, rich and poor, for he is become the king's right hand,

is clothed with power and authority, and his seat is upon the highest

step of the throne!  Now sweep away this creeping night, and bring

the light and cheer again, that all the world may bless thee."



But I said:



"That a common man should be shamed before the world, is nothing;

but it were dishonor to the _king_ if any that saw his minister naked

should not also see him delivered from his shame.  If I might ask

that my clothes be brought again--"



"They are not meet," the king broke in.  "Fetch raiment of another

sort; clothe him like a prince!"



My idea worked.  I wanted to keep things as they were till the

eclipse was total, otherwise they would be trying again to get

me to dismiss the darkness, and of course I couldn't do it.  Sending

for the clothes gained some delay, but not enough.  So I had to make

another excuse.  I said it would be but natural if the king should

change his mind and repent to some extent of what he had done

under excitement; therefore I would let the darkness grow a while,

and if at the end of a reasonable time the king had kept his mind

the same, the darkness should be dismissed.  Neither the king nor

anybody else was satisfied with that arrangement, but I had

to stick to my point.



It grew darker and darker and blacker and blacker, while I struggled

with those awkward sixth-century clothes.  It got to be pitch dark,

at last, and the multitude groaned with horror to feel the cold

uncanny night breezes fan through the place and see the stars

come out and twinkle in the sky.  At last the eclipse was total,

and I was very glad of it, but everybody else was in misery; which

was quite natural. I said:



"The king, by his silence, still stands to the terms."  Then

I lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then I said, with

the most awful solemnity: "Let the enchantment dissolve and

pass harmless away!"



There was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and

that graveyard hush.  But when the silver rim of the sun pushed

itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with

a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me

with blessings and gratitude; and Clarence was not the last of

the wash, to be sure.







CHAPTER VII



MERLIN'S TOWER



Inasmuch as I was now the second personage in the Kingdom, as far

as political power and authority were concerned, much was made

of me.  My raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,

and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  But habit

would soon reconcile me to my clothes; I was aware of that.  I was

given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after

the king's.  They were aglow with loud-colored silken hangings,

but the stone floors had nothing but rushes on them for a carpet,

and they were misfit rushes at that, being not all of one breed.

As for conveniences, properly speaking, there weren't any.  I mean

_little_ conveniences; it is the little conveniences that make

the real comfort of life.  The big oaken chairs, graced with rude

carvings, were well enough, but that was the stopping place.

There was no soap, no matches, no looking-glass--except a metal

one, about as powerful as a pail of water.  And not a chromo.

I had been used to chromos for years, and I saw now that without

my suspecting it a passion for art had got worked into the fabric

of my being, and was become a part of me.  It made me homesick

to look around over this proud and gaudy but heartless barrenness

and remember that in our house in East Hartford, all unpretending

as it was, you couldn't go into a room but you would find an

insurance-chromo, or at least a three-color God-Bless-Our-Home

over the door; and in the parlor we had nine.  But here, even in

my grand room of state, there wasn't anything in the nature of

a picture except a thing the size of a bedquilt, which was either

woven or knitted (it had darned places in it), and nothing in it

was the right color or the right shape; and as for proportions,

even Raphael himself couldn't have botched them more formidably,

after all his practice on those nightmares they call his "celebrated

Hampton Court cartoons."  Raphael was a bird.  We had several

of his chromos; one was his "Miraculous Draught of Fishes," where

he puts in a miracle of his own--puts three men into a canoe which

wouldn't have held a dog without upsetting.  I always admired

to study R.'s art, it was so fresh and unconventional.



There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle.  I had

a great many servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the

anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I had to go and call for him.

There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full

of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag floating in it was

the thing that produced what was regarded as light.  A lot of

these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it

down enough to make it dismal.  If you went out at night, your

servants carried torches.  There were no books, pens, paper or

ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows.

It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes

a big thing.  But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't

any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco.  I saw that I was just another

Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society

but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life

bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize

things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy.  Well,

that was in my line.



One thing troubled me along at first--the immense interest which

people took in me.  Apparently the whole nation wanted a look

at me.  It soon transpired that the eclipse had scared the British

world almost to death; that while it lasted the whole country,

from one end to the other, was in a pitiable state of panic, and

the churches, hermitages, and monkeries overflowed with praying

and weeping poor creatures who thought the end of the world was

come.  Then had followed the news that the producer of this awful

event was a stranger, a mighty magician at Arthur's court; that he

could have blown out the sun like a candle, and was just going

to do it when his mercy was purchased, and he then dissolved

his enchantments, and was now recognized and honored as the man

who had by his unaided might saved the globe from destruction and

its peoples from extinction.  Now if you consider that everybody

believed that, and not only believed it, but never even dreamed

of doubting it, you will easily understand that there was not

a person in all Britain that would not have walked fifty miles

to get a sight of me.  Of course I was all the talk--all other

subjects were dropped; even the king became suddenly a person of

minor interest and notoriety.  Within twenty-four hours the

delegations began to arrive, and from that time onward for a fortnight

they kept coming.  The village was crowded, and all the countryside.

I had to go out a dozen times a day and show myself to these

reverent and awe-stricken multitudes.  It came to be a great burden,

as to time and trouble, but of course it was at the same time

compensatingly agreeable to be so celebrated and such a center

of homage.  It turned Brer Merlin green with envy and spite, which

was a great satisfaction to me.  But there was one thing I couldn't

understand--nobody had asked for an autograph.  I spoke to Clarence

about it.  By George!  I had to explain to him what it was.  Then

he said nobody in the country could read or write but a few dozen

priests.  Land! think of that.



There was another thing that troubled me a little.  Those multitudes

presently began to agitate for another miracle.  That was natural.

To be able to carry back to their far homes the boast that they

had seen the man who could command the sun, riding in the heavens,

and be obeyed, would make them great in the eyes of their neighbors,

and envied by them all; but to be able to also say they had seen

him work a miracle themselves--why, people would come a distance

to see _them_.  The pressure got to be pretty strong.  There was

going to be an eclipse of the moon, and I knew the date and hour,

but it was too far away.  Two years.  I would have given a good

deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was

a big market for it.  It seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,

and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn't have any

use for it, as like as not.  If it had been booked for only a month

away, I could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, I couldn't

seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so I gave up

trying.  Next, Clarence found that old Merlin was making himself

busy on the sly among those people.  He was spreading a report that

I was a humbug, and that the reason I didn't accommodate the people

with a miracle was because I couldn't.  I saw that I must do

something.  I presently thought out a plan.



By my authority as executive I threw Merlin into prison--the same

cell I had occupied myself.  Then I gave public notice by herald

and trumpet that I should be busy with affairs of state for

a fortnight, but about the end of that time I would take a moment's

leisure and blow up Merlin's stone tower by fires from heaven;

in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him

beware.  Furthermore, I would perform but this one miracle at

this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,

I would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.

Quiet ensued.



I took Clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we

went to work privately.  I told him that this was a sort of miracle

that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden

death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  That made

his mouth safe enough.  Clandestinely we made a few bushels of

first-rate blasting powder, and I superintended my armorers while

they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  This old stone

tower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it was Roman,

and four hundred years old.  Yes, and handsome, after a rude

fashion, and clothed with ivy from base to summit, as with a shirt

of scale mail.  It stood on a lonely eminence, in good view from

the castle, and about half a mile away.



Working by night, we stowed the powder in the tower--dug stones

out, on the inside, and buried the powder in the walls themselves,

which were fifteen feet thick at the base.  We put in a peck

at a time, in a dozen places.  We could have blown up the Tower

of London with these charges.  When the thirteenth night was come

we put up our lightning-rod, bedded it in one of the batches of

powder, and ran wires from it to the other batches.  Everybody

had shunned that locality from the day of my proclamation, but

on the morning of the fourteenth I thought best to warn the people,

through the heralds, to keep clear away--a quarter of a mile away.

Then added, by command, that at some time during the twenty-four

hours I would consummate the miracle, but would first give a brief

notice; by flags on the castle towers if in the daytime, by

torch-baskets in the same places if at night.



Thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and I was

not much afraid of a failure; still, I shouldn't have cared for

a delay of a day or two; I should have explained that I was busy

with affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.



Of course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one without

a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  I kept secluded,

and watched the weather.  Clarence dropped in from time to time

and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the

time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far

as one could see from the battlements.  At last the wind sprang up

and a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at

nightfall.  For a little while I watched that distant cloud spread

and blacken, then I judged it was time for me to appear.  I ordered

the torch-baskets to be lit, and Merlin liberated and sent to me.

A quarter of an hour later I ascended the parapet and there found

the king and the court assembled and gazing off in the darkness

toward Merlin's Tower.  Already the darkness was so heavy that

one could not see far; these people and the old turrets, being

partly in deep shadow and partly in the red glow from the great

torch-baskets overhead, made a good deal of a picture.



Merlin arrived in a gloomy mood.  I said:



"You wanted to burn me alive when I had not done you any harm,

and latterly you have been trying to injure my professional

reputation.  Therefore I am going to call down fire and blow up

your tower, but it is only fair to give you a chance; now if you

think you can break my enchantments and ward off the fires, step

to the bat, it's your innings."



"I can, fair sir, and I will. Doubt it not."



He drew an imaginary circle on the stones of the roof, and burnt

a pinch of powder in it, which sent up a small cloud of aromatic

smoke, whereat everybody fell back and began to cross themselves

and get uncomfortable.  Then he began to mutter and make passes

in the air with his hands.  He worked himself up slowly and

gradually into a sort of frenzy, and got to thrashing around with

his arms like the sails of a windmill.  By this time the storm had

about reached us; the gusts of wind were flaring the torches and

making the shadows swash about, the first heavy drops of rain

were falling, the world abroad was black as pitch, the lightning

began to wink fitfully.  Of course, my rod would be loading itself

now.  In fact, things were imminent. So I said:



"You have had time enough.  I have given you every advantage,

and not interfered.  It is plain your magic is weak. It is only

fair that I begin now."



I made about three passes in the air, and then there was an awful

crash and that old tower leaped into the sky in chunks, along

with a vast volcanic fountain of fire that turned night to noonday,

and showed a thousand acres of human beings groveling on the ground

in a general collapse of consternation.  Well, it rained mortar and

masonry the rest of the week.  This was the report; but probably

the facts would have modified it.



It was an effective miracle.  The great bothersome temporary

population vanished.  There were a good many thousand tracks

in the mud the next morning, but they were all outward bound.

If I had advertised another miracle I couldn't have raised an

audience with a sheriff.



Merlin's stock was flat.  The king wanted to stop his wages; he

even wanted to banish him, but I interfered.  I said he would be

useful to work the weather, and attend to small matters like that,

and I would give him a lift now and then when his poor little

parlor-magic soured on him.  There wasn't a rag of his tower left,

but I had the government rebuild it for him, and advised him

to take boarders; but he was too high-toned for that.  And as for

being grateful, he never even said thank you.  He was a rather

hard lot, take him how you might; but then you couldn't fairly

expect a man to be sweet that had been set back so.







CHAPTER VIII



THE BOSS



To be vested with enormous authority is a fine thing; but to have

the on-looking world consent to it is a finer.  The tower episode

solidified my power, and made it impregnable.  If any were perchance

disposed to be jealous and critical before that, they experienced

a change of heart, now.  There was not any one in the kingdom

who would have considered it good judgment to meddle with my matters.



I was fast getting adjusted to my situation and circumstances.

For a time, I used to wake up, mornings, and smile at my "dream,"

and listen for the Colt's factory whistle; but that sort of thing

played itself out, gradually, and at last I was fully able to realize

that I was actually living in the sixth century, and in Arthur's

court, not a lunatic asylum.  After that, I was just as much

at home in that century as I could have been in any other; and

as for preference, I wouldn't have traded it for the twentieth.

Look at the opportunities here for a man of knowledge, brains,

pluck, and enterprise to sail in and grow up with the country.

The grandest field that ever was; and all my own; not a competitor;

not a man who wasn't a baby to me in acquirements and capacities;

whereas, what would I amount to in the twentieth century?  I should

be foreman of a factory, that is about all; and could drag a seine

down street any day and catch a hundred better men than myself.



What a jump I had made!  I couldn't keep from thinking about it,

and contemplating it, just as one does who has struck oil.  There

was nothing back of me that could approach it, unless it might be

Joseph's case; and Joseph's only approached it, it didn't equal

it, quite.  For it stands to reason that as Joseph's splendid

financial ingenuities advantaged nobody but the king, the general

public must have regarded him with a good deal of disfavor, whereas

I had done my entire public a kindness in sparing the sun, and was

popular by reason of it.



I was no shadow of a king; I was the substance; the king himself

was the shadow.  My power was colossal; and it was not a mere

name, as such things have generally been, it was the genuine

article.  I stood here, at the very spring and source of the second

great period of the world's history; and could see the trickling

stream of that history gather and deepen and broaden, and roll

its mighty tides down the far centuries; and I could note the

upspringing of adventurers like myself in the shelter of its long

array of thrones: De Montforts, Gavestons, Mortimers, Villierses;

the war-making, campaign-directing wantons of France, and Charles

the Second's scepter-wielding drabs; but nowhere in the procession

was my full-sized fellow visible.  I was a Unique; and glad to know

that that fact could not be dislodged or challenged for thirteen

centuries and a half, for sure.  Yes, in power I was equal to

the king.  At the same time there was another power that was

a trifle stronger than both of us put together.  That was the Church.

I do not wish to disguise that fact.  I couldn't, if I wanted to.

But never mind about that, now; it will show up, in its proper

place, later on.  It didn't cause me any trouble in the beginning

--at least any of consequence.



Well, it was a curious country, and full of interest.  And the

people!  They were the quaintest and simplest and trustingest race;

why, they were nothing but rabbits.  It was pitiful for a person

born in a wholesome free atmosphere to listen to their humble

and hearty outpourings of loyalty toward their king and Church

and nobility; as if they had any more occasion to love and honor

king and Church and noble than a slave has to love and honor

the lash, or a dog has to love and honor the stranger that kicks him!

Why, dear me, _any_ kind of royalty, howsoever modified, _any_ kind

of aristocracy, howsoever pruned, is rightly an insult; but if you

are born and brought up under that sort of arrangement you probably

never find it out for yourself, and don't believe it when somebody

else tells you.  It is enough to make a body ashamed of his race

to think of the sort of froth that has always occupied its thrones

without shadow of right or reason, and the seventh-rate people

that have always figured as its aristocracies--a company of monarchs

and nobles who, as a rule, would have achieved only poverty and

obscurity if left, like their betters, to their own exertions.



The most of King Arthur's British nation were slaves, pure and

simple, and bore that name, and wore the iron collar on their

necks; and the rest were slaves in fact, but without the name;

they imagined themselves men and freemen, and called themselves

so.  The truth was, the nation as a body was in the world for one

object, and one only: to grovel before king and Church and noble;

to slave for them, sweat blood for them, starve that they might

be fed, work that they might play, drink misery to the dregs that

they might be happy, go naked that they might wear silks and

jewels, pay taxes that they might be spared from paying them,

be familiar all their lives with the degrading language and postures

of adulation that they might walk in pride and think themselves

the gods of this world.  And for all this, the thanks they got were

cuffs and contempt; and so poor-spirited were they that they took

even this sort of attention as an honor.



Inherited ideas are a curious thing, and interesting to observe

and examine.  I had mine, the king and his people had theirs.

In both cases they flowed in ruts worn deep by time and habit,

and the man who should have proposed to divert them by reason

and argument would have had a long contract on his hands.  For

instance, those people had inherited the idea that all men without

title and a long pedigree, whether they had great natural gifts

and acquirements or hadn't, were creatures of no more consideration

than so many animals, bugs, insects; whereas I had inherited the idea

that human daws who can consent to masquerade in the peacock-shams

of inherited dignities and unearned titles, are of no good but

to be laughed at.  The way I was looked upon was odd, but it was

natural.  You know how the keeper and the public regard the elephant

in the menagerie: well, that is the idea.  They are full of

admiration of his vast bulk and his prodigious strength; they

speak with pride of the fact that he can do a hundred marvels

which are far and away beyond their own powers; and they speak

with the same pride of the fact that in his wrath he is able

to drive a thousand men before him.  But does that make him one

of _them_?  No; the raggedest tramp in the pit would smile at

the idea.  He couldn't comprehend it; couldn't take it in; couldn't

in any remote way conceive of it.  Well, to the king, the nobles,

and all the nation, down to the very slaves and tramps, I was

just that kind of an elephant, and nothing more.  I was admired,

also feared; but it was as an animal is admired and feared.

The animal is not reverenced, neither was I; I was not even

respected.  I had no pedigree, no inherited title; so in the king's

and nobles' eyes I was mere dirt; the people regarded me with

wonder and awe, but there was no reverence mixed with it; through

the force of inherited ideas they were not able to conceive of

anything being entitled to that except pedigree and lordship.

There you see the hand of that awful power, the Roman Catholic

Church.  In two or three little centuries it had converted a nation

of men to a nation of worms.  Before the day of the Church's

supremacy in the world, men were men, and held their heads up,

and had a man's pride and spirit and independence; and what

of greatness and position a person got, he got mainly by achievement,

not by birth.  But then the Church came to the front, with an axe

to grind; and she was wise, subtle, and knew more than one way

to skin a cat--or a nation; she invented "divine right of kings,"

and propped it all around, brick by brick, with the Beatitudes

--wrenching them from their good purpose to make them fortify

an evil one; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience

to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice; she preached (to the

commoner) meekness under insult; preached (still to the commoner,

always to the commoner) patience, meanness of spirit, non-resistance

under oppression; and she introduced heritable ranks and

aristocracies, and taught all the Christian populations of the earth

to bow down to them and worship them.  Even down to my birth-century

that poison was still in the blood of Christendom, and the best

of English commoners was still content to see his inferiors

impudently continuing to hold a number of positions, such as

lordships and the throne, to which the grotesque laws of his country

did not allow him to aspire; in fact, he was not merely contented

with this strange condition of things, he was even able to persuade

himself that he was proud of it.  It seems to show that there isn't

anything you can't stand, if you are only born and bred to it.

Of course that taint, that reverence for rank and title, had been

in our American blood, too--I know that; but when I left America

it had disappeared--at least to all intents and purposes.  The

remnant of it was restricted to the dudes and dudesses.  When

a disease has worked its way down to that level, it may fairly

be said to be out of the system.



But to return to my anomalous position in King Arthur's kingdom.

Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master

intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement

the one and only actually great man in that whole British world;

and yet there and then, just as in the remote England of my

birth-time, the sheep-witted earl who could claim long descent

from a king's leman, acquired at second-hand from the slums of

London, was a better man than I was.  Such a personage was fawned

upon in Arthur's realm and reverently looked up to by everybody,

even though his dispositions were as mean as his intelligence,

and his morals as base as his lineage.  There were times when

_he_ could sit down in the king's presence, but I couldn't.  I could

have got a title easily enough, and that would have raised me

a large step in everybody's eyes; even in the king's, the giver

of it.  But I didn't ask for it; and I declined it when it was

offered.  I couldn't have enjoyed such a thing with my notions;

and it wouldn't have been fair, anyway, because as far back as

I could go, our tribe had always been short of the bar sinister.

I couldn't have felt really and satisfactorily fine and proud

and set-up over any title except one that should come from the nation

itself, the only legitimate source; and such an one I hoped to win;

and in the course of years of honest and honorable endeavor, I did

win it and did wear it with a high and clean pride.  This title

fell casually from the lips of a blacksmith, one day, in a village,

was caught up as a happy thought and tossed from mouth to mouth

with a laugh and an affirmative vote; in ten days it had swept

the kingdom, and was become as familiar as the king's name.  I was

never known by any other designation afterward, whether in the

nation's talk or in grave debate upon matters of state at the

council-board of the sovereign.  This title, translated into modern

speech, would be THE BOSS.  Elected by the nation.  That suited me.

And it was a pretty high title.  There were very few THE'S, and

I was one of them.  If you spoke of the duke, or the earl, or

the bishop, how could anybody tell which one you meant?  But if

you spoke of The King or The Queen or The Boss, it was different.



Well, I liked the king, and as king I respected him--respected

the office; at least respected it as much as I was capable of

respecting any unearned supremacy; but as MEN I looked down upon

him and his nobles--privately.  And he and they liked me, and

respected my office; but as an animal, without birth or sham title,

they looked down upon me--and were not particularly private about it,

either.  I didn't charge for my opinion about them, and they didn't

charge for their opinion about me: the account was square, the

books balanced, everybody was satisfied.







CHAPTER IX



THE TOURNAMENT



They were always having grand tournaments there at Camelot; and

very stirring and picturesque and ridiculous human bull-fights

they were, too, but just a little wearisome to the practical mind.

However, I was generally on hand--for two reasons: a man must

not hold himself aloof from the things which his friends and his

community have at heart if he would be liked--especially as

a statesman; and both as business man and statesman I wanted

to study the tournament and see if I couldn't invent an improvement

on it.  That reminds me to remark, in passing, that the very first

official thing I did, in my administration--and it was on the very

first day of it, too--was to start a patent office; for I knew

that a country without a patent office and good patent laws was

just a crab, and couldn't travel any way but sideways or backways.



Things ran along, a tournament nearly every week; and now and then

the boys used to want me to take a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and

the rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much

government machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.



We had one tournament which was continued from day to day during

more than a week, and as many as five hundred knights took part

in it, from first to last.  They were weeks gathering.  They came

on horseback from everywhere; from the very ends of the country,

and even from beyond the sea; and many brought ladies, and all

brought squires and troops of servants.  It was a most gaudy and

gorgeous crowd, as to costumery, and very characteristic of the

country and the time, in the way of high animal spirits, innocent

indecencies of language, and happy-hearted indifference to morals.

It was fight or look on, all day and every day; and sing, gamble,

dance, carouse half the night every night.  They had a most noble

good time.  You never saw such people.  Those banks of beautiful

ladies, shining in their barbaric splendors, would see a knight

sprawl from his horse in the lists with a lanceshaft the thickness

of your ankle clean through him and the blood spouting, and instead

of fainting they would clap their hands and crowd each other for a

better view; only sometimes one would dive into her handkerchief,

and look ostentatiously broken-hearted, and then you could lay

two to one that there was a scandal there somewhere and she was

afraid the public hadn't found it out.



The noise at night would have been annoying to me ordinarily, but

I didn't mind it in the present circumstances, because it kept me

from hearing the quacks detaching legs and arms from the day's

cripples.  They ruined an uncommon good old cross-cut saw for me,

and broke the saw-buck, too, but I let it pass.  And as for my

axe--well, I made up my mind that the next time I lent an axe

to a surgeon I would pick my century.



I not only watched this tournament from day to day, but detailed

an intelligent priest from my Department of Public Morals and

Agriculture, and ordered him to report it; for it was my purpose

by and by, when I should have gotten the people along far enough,

to start a newspaper.  The first thing you want in a new country,

is a patent office; then work up your school system; and after that,

out with your paper.  A newspaper has its faults, and plenty of them,

but no matter, it's hark from the tomb for a dead nation, and don't

you forget it.  You can't resurrect a dead nation without it; there

isn't any way.  So I wanted to sample things, and be finding out

what sort of reporter-material I might be able to rake together out

of the sixth century when I should come to need it.



Well, the priest did very well, considering.  He got in all

the details, and that is a good thing in a local item: you see,

he had kept books for the undertaker-department of his church

when he was younger, and there, you know, the money's in the details;

the more details, the more swag: bearers, mutes, candles, prayers

--everything counts; and if the bereaved don't buy prayers enough

you mark up your candles with a forked pencil, and your bill

shows up all right.  And he had a good knack at getting in the

complimentary thing here and there about a knight that was likely

to advertise--no, I mean a knight that had influence; and he also

had a neat gift of exaggeration, for in his time he had kept door

for a pious hermit who lived in a sty and worked miracles.



Of course this novice's report lacked whoop and crash and lurid

description, and therefore wanted the true ring; but its antique

wording was quaint and sweet and simple, and full of the fragrances

and flavors of the time, and these little merits made up in a measure

for its more important lacks.  Here is an extract from it:



  Then Sir Brian de les Isles and Grummore Grummorsum,

  knights of the castle, encountered with Sir Aglovale and

  Sir Tor, and Sir Tor smote down Sir Grummore Grummorsum

  to the earth.  Then came Sir Carados of the dolorous

  tower, and Sir Turquine, knights of the castle, and

  there encountered with them Sir Percivale de Galis

  and Sir Lamorak de Galis, that were two brethren, and

  there encountered Sir Percivale with Sir Carados, and

  either brake their spears unto their hands, and then

  Sir Turquine with Sir Lamorak, and either of them smote

  down other, horse and all, to the earth, and either

  parties rescued other and horsed them again.  And Sir

  Arnold, and Sir Gauter, knights of the castle,

  encountered with Sir Brandiles and Sir Kay, and these

  four knights encountered mightily, and brake their

  spears to their hands.  Then came Sir Pertolope from

  the castle, and there encountered with him Sir Lionel,

  and there Sir Pertolope the green knight smote down Sir

  Lionel, brother to Sir Launcelot.  All this was marked

  by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.

  Then Sir Bleobaris brake his spear upon Sir Gareth,

  but of that stroke Sir Bleobaris fell to the earth.

  When Sir Galihodin saw that, he bad Sir Gareth keep him,

  and Sir Gareth smote him to the earth.  Then Sir Galihud

  gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise

  Sir Gareth served him, and Sir Dinadan and his brother

  La Cote Male Taile, and Sir Sagramore le Disirous, and

  Sir Dodinas le Savage; all these he bare down with one

  spear.  When King Aswisance of Ireland saw Sir Gareth

  fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time

  seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,

  he seemed blue.  And thus at every course that he rode

  to and fro he changed his color, so that there might

  neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.

  Then Sir Agwisance the King of Ireland encountered

  with Sir Gareth, and there Sir Gareth smote him from

  his horse, saddle and all.  And then came King Carados

  of Scotland, and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and

  man.  And in the same wise he served King Uriens of the

  land of Gore.  And then there came in Six Bagdemagus,

  and Sir Gareth smote him down horse and man to the

  earth.  And Bagdemagus's son Meliganus brake a spear

  upon Sir Gareth mightily and knightly.  And then Sir

  Galahault the noble prince cried on high, Knight with

  the many colors, well hast thou justed; now make thee

  ready that I may just with thee.  Sir Gareth heard him,

  and he gat a great spear, and so they encountered

  together, and there the prince brake his spear; but Sir

  Gareth smote him upon the left side of the helm, that

  he reeled here and there, and he had fallen down had not

  his men recovered him.  Truly, said King Arthur, that

  knight with the many colors is a good knight.  Wherefore

  the king called unto him Sir Launcelot, and prayed him

  to encounter with that knight.  Sir, said Launcelot, I

  may as well find in my heart for to forbear him at

  this time, for he hath had travail enough this day, and

  when a good knight doth so well upon some day, it is

  no good knight's part to let him of his worship, and,

  namely, when he seeth a knight hath done so great

  labour; for peradventure, said Sir Launcelot, his

  quarrel is here this day, and peradventure he is best

  beloved with this lady of all that be here, for I see

  well he paineth himself and enforceth him to do great

  deeds, and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, as for me,

  this day he shall have the honour; though it lay in my

  power to put him from it, I would not.



There was an unpleasant little episode that day, which for reasons

of state I struck out of my priest's report.  You will have noticed

that Garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  When

I say Garry I mean Sir Gareth.  Garry was my private pet name

for him; it suggests that I had a deep affection for him, and that

was the case.  But it was a private pet name only, and never spoken

aloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not

have endured a familiarity like that from me.  Well, to proceed:

I sat in the private box set apart for me as the king's minister.

While Sir Dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,

he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always

making up to me, because I was a stranger and he liked to have

a fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that

stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while

the other person looks sick.  I had always responded to his efforts

as well as I could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,

too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew the one

particular anecdote which I had heard oftenest and had most hated

and most loathed all my life, he had at least spared it me.  It was

one which I had heard attributed to every humorous person who

had ever stood on American soil, from Columbus down to Artemus Ward.

It was about a humorous lecturer who flooded an ignorant audience

with the killingest jokes for an hour and never got a laugh; and

then when he was leaving, some gray simpletons wrung him gratefully

by the hand and said it had been the funniest thing they had ever

heard, and "it was all they could do to keep from laughin' right

out in meetin'."  That anecdote never saw the day that it was

worth the telling; and yet I had sat under the telling of it

hundreds and thousands and millions and billions of times, and

cried and cursed all the way through.  Then who can hope to know

what my feelings were, to hear this armor-plated ass start in on

it again, in the murky twilight of tradition, before the dawn of

history, while even Lactantius might be referred to as "the late

Lactantius," and the Crusades wouldn't be born for five hundred

years yet?  Just as he finished, the call-boy came; so, haw-hawing

like a demon, he went rattling and clanking out like a crate of

loose castings, and I knew nothing more.  It was some minutes

before I came to, and then I opened my eyes just in time to see

Sir Gareth fetch him an awful welt, and I unconsciously out with

the prayer, "I hope to gracious he's killed!"  But by ill-luck,

before I had got half through with the words, Sir Gareth crashed

into Sir Sagramor le Desirous and sent him thundering over his

horse's crupper, and Sir Sagramor caught my remark and thought

I meant it for _him_.



Well, whenever one of those people got a thing into his head,

there was no getting it out again.  I knew that, so I saved my

breath, and offered no explanations.  As soon as Sir Sagramor

got well, he notified me that there was a little account to settle

between us, and he named a day three or four years in the future;

place of settlement, the lists where the offense had been given.

I said I would be ready when he got back.  You see, he was going

for the Holy Grail.  The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail

now and then.  It was a several years' cruise.  They always put in

the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way,

though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was,

and I don't think any of them actually expected to find it, or

would have known what to do with it if he _had_ run across it.

You see, it was just the Northwest Passage of that day, as you may

say; that was all.  Every year expeditions went out holy grailing,

and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for _them_.  There

was worlds of reputation in it, but no money.  Why, they actually

wanted _me_ to put in!  Well, I should smile.







CHAPTER X



BEGINNINGS OF CIVILIZATION



The Round Table soon heard of the challenge, and of course it was

a good deal discussed, for such things interested the boys.

The king thought I ought now to set forth in quest of adventures,

so that I might gain renown and be the more worthy to meet

Sir Sagramor when the several years should have rolled away.

I excused myself for the present; I said it would take me three

or four years yet to get things well fixed up and going smoothly;

then I should be ready; all the chances were that at the end of

that time Sir Sagramor would still be out grailing, so no valuable

time would be lost by the postponement; I should then have been

in office six or seven years, and I believed my system and machinery

would be so well developed that I could take a holiday without

its working any harm.



I was pretty well satisfied with what I had already accomplished.

In various quiet nooks and corners I had the beginnings of all

sorts of industries under way--nuclei of future vast factories,

the iron and steel missionaries of my future civilization.  In these

were gathered together the brightest young minds I could find,

and I kept agents out raking the country for more, all the time.

I was training a crowd of ignorant folk into experts--experts

in every sort of handiwork and scientific calling.  These nurseries

of mine went smoothly and privately along undisturbed in their

obscure country retreats, for nobody was allowed to come into their

precincts without a special permit--for I was afraid of the Church.



I had started a teacher-factory and a lot of Sunday-schools the

first thing; as a result, I now had an admirable system of graded

schools in full blast in those places, and also a complete variety

of Protestant congregations all in a prosperous and growing

condition.  Everybody could be any kind of a Christian he wanted

to; there was perfect freedom in that matter.  But I confined public

religious teaching to the churches and the Sunday-schools, permitting

nothing of it in my other educational buildings.  I could have

given my own sect the preference and made everybody a Presbyterian

without any trouble, but that would have been to affront a law

of human nature: spiritual wants and instincts are as various in

the human family as are physical appetites, complexions, and

features, and a man is only at his best, morally, when he is

equipped with the religious garment whose color and shape and

size most nicely accommodate themselves to the spiritual complexion,

angularities, and stature of the individual who wears it; and,

besides, I was afraid of a united Church; it makes a mighty power,

the mightiest conceivable, and then when it by and by gets into

selfish hands, as it is always bound to do, it means death to

human liberty and paralysis to human thought.



All mines were royal property, and there were a good many of them.

They had formerly been worked as savages always work mines--holes

grubbed in the earth and the mineral brought up in sacks of hide by

hand, at the rate of a ton a day; but I had begun to put the mining

on a scientific basis as early as I could.



Yes, I had made pretty handsome progress when Sir Sagramor's

challenge struck me.



Four years rolled by--and then!  Well, you would never imagine

it in the world.  Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in

safe hands.  The despotism of heaven is the one absolutely perfect

government.  An earthly despotism would be the absolutely perfect

earthly government, if the conditions were the same, namely, the

despot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease

of life perpetual.  But as a perishable perfect man must die, and

leave his despotism in the hands of an imperfect successor, an

earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is

the worst form that is possible.



My works showed what a despot could do with the resources of

a kingdom at his command.  Unsuspected by this dark land, I had

the civilization of the nineteenth century booming under its very

nose!  It was fenced away from the public view, but there it was,

a gigantic and unassailable fact--and to be heard from, yet, if

I lived and had luck.  There it was, as sure a fact and as substantial

a fact as any serene volcano, standing innocent with its smokeless

summit in the blue sky and giving no sign of the rising hell in its

bowels.  My schools and churches were children four years before;

they were grown-up now; my shops of that day were vast factories

now; where I had a dozen trained men then, I had a thousand now;

where I had one brilliant expert then, I had fifty now.  I stood

with my hand on the cock, so to speak, ready to turn it on and

flood the midnight world with light at any moment.  But I was not

going to do the thing in that sudden way.  It was not my policy.

The people could not have stood it; and, moreover, I should have

had the Established Roman Catholic Church on my back in a minute.



No, I had been going cautiously all the while.  I had had confidential

agents trickling through the country some time, whose office was

to undermine knighthood by imperceptible degrees, and to gnaw

a little at this and that and the other superstition, and so prepare

the way gradually for a better order of things.  I was turning on

my light one-candle-power at a time, and meant to continue to do so.



I had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom,

and they were doing very well.  I meant to work this racket more

and more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me.

One of my deepest secrets was my West Point--my military academy.

I kept that most jealously out of sight; and I did the same with my

naval academy which I had established at a remote seaport.  Both

were prospering to my satisfaction.



Clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right

hand.  He was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn't

anything he couldn't turn his hand to.  Of late I had been training

him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start

in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for

experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries.  He took

to it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.

Already he had doubled himself in one way; he talked sixth century

and wrote nineteenth.  His journalistic style was climbing,

steadily; it was already up to the back settlement Alabama mark,

and couldn't be told from the editorial output of that region

either by matter or flavor.



We had another large departure on hand, too.  This was a telegraph

and a telephone; our first venture in this line.  These wires were

for private service only, as yet, and must be kept private until

a riper day should come.  We had a gang of men on the road, working

mainly by night.  They were stringing ground wires; we were afraid

to put up poles, for they would attract too much inquiry.  Ground

wires were good enough, in both instances, for my wires were

protected by an insulation of my own invention which was perfect.

My men had orders to strike across country, avoiding roads, and

establishing connection with any considerable towns whose lights

betrayed their presence, and leaving experts in charge. Nobody

could tell you how to find any place in the kingdom, for nobody

ever went intentionally to any place, but only struck it by

accident in his wanderings, and then generally left it without

thinking to inquire what its name was.  At one time and another

we had sent out topographical expeditions to survey and map the

kingdom, but the priests had always interfered and raised trouble.

So we had given the thing up, for the present; it would be poor

wisdom to antagonize the Church.



As for the general condition of the country, it was as it had been

when I arrived in it, to all intents and purposes.  I had made

changes, but they were necessarily slight, and they were not

noticeable.  Thus far, I had not even meddled with taxation,

outside of the taxes which provided the royal revenues.  I had

systematized those, and put the service on an effective and

righteous basis.  As a result, these revenues were already quadrupled,

and yet the burden was so much more equably distributed than

before, that all the kingdom felt a sense of relief, and the praises

of my administration were hearty and general.



Personally, I struck an interruption, now, but I did not mind it,

it could not have happened at a better time.  Earlier it could

have annoyed me, but now everything was in good hands and swimming

right along.  The king had reminded me several times, of late, that

the postponement I had asked for, four years before, had about

run out now.  It was a hint that I ought to be starting out to seek

adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy

of the honor of breaking a lance with Sir Sagramor, who was still

out grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions,

and might be found any year, now.  So you see I was expecting

this interruption; it did not take me by surprise.







CHAPTER XI



THE YANKEE IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURES



There never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were

of both sexes.  Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps

arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or

other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where

she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.

Now you would think that the first thing the king would do after

listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be

to ask for credentials--yes, and a pointer or two as to locality

of castle, best route to it, and so on.  But nobody ever thought

of so simple and common-sense a thing at that.  No, everybody

swallowed these people's lies whole, and never asked a question

of any sort or about anything.  Well, one day when I was not

around, one of these people came along--it was a she one, this

time--and told a tale of the usual pattern.  Her mistress was

a captive in a vast and gloomy castle, along with forty-four other

young and beautiful girls, pretty much all of them princesses;

they had been languishing in that cruel captivity for twenty-six

years; the masters of the castle were three stupendous brothers,

each with four arms and one eye--the eye in the center of the

forehead, and as big as a fruit.  Sort of fruit not mentioned;

their usual slovenliness in statistics.



Would you believe it?  The king and the whole Round Table were

in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.

Every knight of the Table jumped for the chance, and begged for it;

but to their vexation and chagrin the king conferred it upon me,

who had not asked for it at all.



By an effort, I contained my joy when Clarence brought me the news.

But he--he could not contain his.  His mouth gushed delight and

gratitude in a steady discharge--delight in my good fortune,

gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me.

He could keep neither his legs nor his body still, but pirouetted

about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness.



On my side, I could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon

me this benefaction, but I kept my vexation under the surface

for policy's sake, and did what I could to let on to be glad.

Indeed, I _said_ I was glad.  And in a way it was true; I was as

glad as a person is when he is scalped.



Well, one must make the best of things, and not waste time with

useless fretting, but get down to business and see what can be

done.  In all lies there is wheat among the chaff; I must get at

the wheat in this case: so I sent for the girl and she came.  She

was a comely enough creature, and soft and modest, but, if signs

went for anything, she didn't know as much as a lady's watch.  I said:



"My dear, have you been questioned as to particulars?"



She said she hadn't.



"Well, I didn't expect you had, but I thought I would ask, to make

sure; it's the way I've been raised.  Now you mustn't take it

unkindly if I remind you that as we don't know you, we must go

a little slow.  You may be all right, of course, and we'll hope

that you are; but to take it for granted isn't business.  _You_

understand that.  I'm obliged to ask you a few questions; just

answer up fair and square, and don't be afraid.  Where do you

live, when you are at home?"



"In the land of Moder, fair sir."



"Land of Moder.  I don't remember hearing of it before.

Parents living?"



"As to that, I know not if they be yet on live, sith it is many

years that I have lain shut up in the castle."



"Your name, please?"



"I hight the Demoiselle Alisande la Carteloise, an it please you."



"Do you know anybody here who can identify you?"



"That were not likely, fair lord, I being come hither now for

the first time."



"Have you brought any letters--any documents--any proofs that

you are trustworthy and truthful?"



"Of a surety, no; and wherefore should I?  Have I not a tongue,

and cannot I say all that myself?"



"But _your_ saying it, you know, and somebody else's saying it,

is different."



"Different?  How might that be?  I fear me I do not understand."



"Don't _understand_?  Land of--why, you see--you see--why, great Scott,

can't you understand a little thing like that?  Can't you understand

the difference between your--_why_ do you look so innocent and idiotic!"



"I?  In truth I know not, but an it were the will of God."



"Yes, yes, I reckon that's about the size of it.  Don't mind my

seeming excited; I'm not.  Let us change the subject.  Now as

to this castle, with forty-five princesses in it, and three ogres

at the head of it, tell me--where is this harem?"



"Harem?"



"The _castle_, you understand; where is the castle?"



"Oh, as to that, it is great, and strong, and well beseen, and

lieth in a far country.  Yes, it is many leagues."



"_How_ many?"



"Ah, fair sir, it were woundily hard to tell, they are so many,

and do so lap the one upon the other, and being made all in the

same image and tincted with the same color, one may not know

the one league from its fellow, nor how to count them except

they be taken apart, and ye wit well it were God's work to do

that, being not within man's capacity; for ye will note--"



"Hold on, hold on, never mind about the distance; _whereabouts_

does the castle lie?  What's the direction from here?"



"Ah, please you sir, it hath no direction from here; by reason

that the road lieth not straight, but turneth evermore; wherefore

the direction of its place abideth not, but is some time under

the one sky and anon under another, whereso if ye be minded that

it is in the east, and wend thitherward, ye shall observe that

the way of the road doth yet again turn upon itself by the space

of half a circle, and this marvel happing again and yet again and

still again, it will grieve you that you had thought by vanities

of the mind to thwart and bring to naught the will of Him that

giveth not a castle a direction from a place except it pleaseth

Him, and if it please Him not, will the rather that even all castles

and all directions thereunto vanish out of the earth, leaving the

places wherein they tarried desolate and vacant, so warning His

creatures that where He will He will, and where He will not He--"



"Oh, that's all right, that's all right, give us a rest; never mind

about the direction, _hang_ the direction--I beg pardon, I beg

a thousand pardons, I am not well to-day; pay no attention when

I soliloquize, it is an old habit, an old, bad habit, and hard

to get rid of when one's digestion is all disordered with eating

food that was raised forever and ever before he was born; good

land! a man can't keep his functions regular on spring chickens

thirteen hundred years old.  But come--never mind about that;

let's--have you got such a thing as a map of that region about

you?  Now a good map--"



"Is it peradventure that manner of thing which of late the unbelievers

have brought from over the great seas, which, being boiled in oil,

and an onion and salt added thereto, doth--"



"What, a map?  What are you talking about?  Don't you know what

a map is?  There, there, never mind, don't explain, I hate

explanations; they fog a thing up so that you can't tell anything

about it.  Run along, dear; good-day; show her the way, Clarence."



Oh, well, it was reasonably plain, now, why these donkeys didn't

prospect these liars for details.  It may be that this girl had

a fact in her somewhere, but I don't believe you could have sluiced

it out with a hydraulic; nor got it with the earlier forms of

blasting, even; it was a case for dynamite.  Why, she was a perfect

ass; and yet the king and his knights had listened to her as if

she had been a leaf out of the gospel.  It kind of sizes up the

whole party.  And think of the simple ways of this court: this

wandering wench hadn't any more trouble to get access to the king

in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse

in my day and country.  In fact, he was glad to see her, glad

to hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she was

as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner.



Just as I was ending-up these reflections, Clarence came back.

I remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl;

hadn't got hold of a single point that could help me to find

the castle.  The youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled,

or something, and intimated that he had been wondering to himself

what I had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for.



"Why, great guns," I said, "don't I want to find the castle?  And

how else would I go about it?"



"La, sweet your worship, one may lightly answer that, I ween.

She will go with thee.  They always do.  She will ride with thee."



"Ride with me?  Nonsense!"



"But of a truth she will.  She will ride with thee.  Thou shalt see."



"What?  She browse around the hills and scour the woods with me

--alone--and I as good as engaged to be married?  Why, it's scandalous.

Think how it would look."



My, the dear face that rose before me!  The boy was eager to know

all about this tender matter.  I swore him to secrecy and then

whispered her name--"Puss Flanagan."  He looked disappointed,

and said he didn't remember the countess.  How natural it was for

the little courtier to give her a rank.  He asked me where she lived.



"In East Har--" I came to myself and stopped, a little confused;

then I said, "Never mind, now; I'll tell you some time."



And might he see her?  Would I let him see her some day?



It was but a little thing to promise--thirteen hundred years

or so--and he so eager; so I said Yes.  But I sighed; I couldn't

help it.  And yet there was no sense in sighing, for she wasn't

born yet.  But that is the way we are made: we don't reason,

where we feel; we just feel.



My expedition was all the talk that day and that night, and the

boys were very good to me, and made much of me, and seemed to have

forgotten their vexation and disappointment, and come to be as

anxious for me to hive those ogres and set those ripe old virgins

loose as if it were themselves that had the contract.  Well, they

_were_ good children--but just children, that is all.  And they

gave me no end of points about how to scout for giants, and how

to scoop them in; and they told me all sorts of charms against

enchantments, and gave me salves and other rubbish to put on my

wounds.  But it never occurred to one of them to reflect that if

I was such a wonderful necromancer as I was pretending to be,

I ought not to need salves or instructions, or charms against

enchantments, and, least of all, arms and armor, on a foray of any

kind--even against fire-spouting dragons, and devils hot from

perdition, let alone such poor adversaries as these I was after,

these commonplace ogres of the back settlements.



I was to have an early breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was

the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor,

and this delayed me a little.  It is troublesome to get into, and

there is so much detail.  First you wrap a layer or two of blanket

around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold

iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these

are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric

so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps

into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and

is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night

shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers,

and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of

people; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with

interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into

the heels.  Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your

cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate,

and you begin to feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate

the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs

down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down,

and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either

for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt

on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms,

your iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your

head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back

of your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould.

This is no time to dance.  Well, a man that is packed away like

that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of

the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.



The boys helped me, or I never could have got in.  Just as we

finished, Sir Bedivere happened in, and I saw that as like as not

I hadn't chosen the most convenient outfit for a long trip.  How

stately he looked; and tall and broad and grand.  He had on his

head a conical steel casque that only came down to his ears, and

for visor had only a narrow steel bar that extended down to his

upper lip and protected his nose; and all the rest of him, from

neck to heel, was flexible chain mail, trousers and all.  But

pretty much all of him was hidden under his outside garment, which

of course was of chain mail, as I said, and hung straight from his

shoulders to his ankles; and from his middle to the bottom, both

before and behind, was divided, so that he could ride and let the

skirts hang down on each side.  He was going grailing, and it was

just the outfit for it, too.  I would have given a good deal for

that ulster, but it was too late now to be fooling around.  The sun

was just up, the king and the court were all on hand to see me off

and wish me luck; so it wouldn't be etiquette for me to tarry.

You don't get on your horse yourself; no, if you tried it you

would get disappointed.  They carry you out, just as they carry

a sun-struck man to the drug store, and put you on, and help get

you to rights, and fix your feet in the stirrups; and all the while

you do feel so strange and stuffy and like somebody else--like

somebody that has been married on a sudden, or struck by lightning,

or something like that, and hasn't quite fetched around yet, and

is sort of numb, and can't just get his bearings.  Then they

stood up the mast they called a spear, in its socket by my left

foot, and I gripped it with my hand; lastly they hung my shield

around my neck, and I was all complete and ready to up anchor

and get to sea.  Everybody was as good to me as they could be,

and a maid of honor gave me the stirrup-cup her own self.  There was

nothing more to do now, but for that damsel to get up behind me on

a pillion, which she did, and put an arm or so around me to hold on.



And so we started, and everybody gave us a goodbye and waved their

handkerchiefs or helmets.  And everybody we met, going down the hill

and through the village was respectful to us, except some shabby

little boys on the outskirts.  They said:



"Oh, what a guy!"  And hove clods at us.



In my experience boys are the same in all ages.  They don't respect

anything, they don't care for anything or anybody.  They say

"Go up, baldhead" to the prophet going his unoffending way in

the gray of antiquity; they sass me in the holy gloom of the

Middle Ages; and I had seen them act the same way in Buchanan's

administration; I remember, because I was there and helped.  The

prophet had his bears and settled with his boys; and I wanted

to get down and settle with mine, but it wouldn't answer, because

I couldn't have got up again.  I hate a country without a derrick.







CHAPTER XII



SLOW TORTURE



Straight off, we were in the country.  It was most lovely and

pleasant in those sylvan solitudes in the early cool morning

in the first freshness of autumn.  From hilltops we saw fair

green valleys lying spread out below, with streams winding through

them, and island groves of trees here and there, and huge lonely

oaks scattered about and casting black blots of shade; and beyond

the valleys we saw the ranges of hills, blue with haze, stretching

away in billowy perspective to the horizon, with at wide intervals

a dim fleck of white or gray on a wave-summit, which we knew was

a castle.  We crossed broad natural lawns sparkling with dew,

and we moved like spirits, the cushioned turf giving out no sound

of footfall; we dreamed along through glades in a mist of green

light that got its tint from the sun-drenched roof of leaves

overhead, and by our feet the clearest and coldest of runlets

went frisking and gossiping over its reefs and making a sort of

whispering music, comfortable to hear; and at times we left the

world behind and entered into the solemn great deeps and rich

gloom of the forest, where furtive wild things whisked and scurried

by and were gone before you could even get your eye on the place

where the noise was; and where only the earliest birds were turning

out and getting to business with a song here and a quarrel yonder

and a mysterious far-off hammering and drumming for worms on

a tree trunk away somewhere in the impenetrable remotenesses of

the woods.  And by and by out we would swing again into the glare.



About the third or fourth or fifth time that we swung out into

the glare--it was along there somewhere, a couple of hours or so

after sun-up--it wasn't as pleasant as it had been.  It was

beginning to get hot.  This was quite noticeable.  We had a very

long pull, after that, without any shade.  Now it is curious how

progressively little frets grow and multiply after they once get

a start.  Things which I didn't mind at all, at first, I began

to mind now--and more and more, too, all the time.  The first

ten or fifteen times I wanted my handkerchief I didn't seem to care;

I got along, and said never mind, it isn't any matter, and dropped

it out of my mind.  But now it was different; I wanted it all

the time; it was nag, nag, nag, right along, and no rest; I couldn't

get it out of my mind; and so at last I lost my temper and said

hang a man that would make a suit of armor without any pockets

in it.  You see I had my handkerchief in my helmet; and some other

things; but it was that kind of a helmet that you can't take off

by yourself.  That hadn't occurred to me when I put it there;

and in fact I didn't know it.  I supposed it would be particularly

convenient there.  And so now, the thought of its being there,

so handy and close by, and yet not get-at-able, made it all the

worse and the harder to bear.  Yes, the thing that you can't get

is the thing that you want, mainly; every one has noticed that.

Well, it took my mind off from everything else; took it clear off,

and centered it in my helmet; and mile after mile, there it stayed,

imagining the handkerchief, picturing the handkerchief; and it

was bitter and aggravating to have the salt sweat keep trickling

down into my eyes, and I couldn't get at it.  It seems like a little

thing, on paper, but it was not a little thing at all; it was

the most real kind of misery.  I would not say it if it was not so.

I made up my mind that I would carry along a reticule next time,

let it look how it might, and people say what they would.  Of course

these iron dudes of the Round Table would think it was scandalous,

and maybe raise Sheol about it, but as for me, give me comfort

first, and style afterwards.  So we jogged along, and now and then

we struck a stretch of dust, and it would tumble up in clouds and

get into my nose and make me sneeze and cry; and of course I said

things I oughtn't to have said, I don't deny that.  I am not

better than others.



We couldn't seem to meet anybody in this lonesome Britain, not

even an ogre; and, in the mood I was in then, it was well for

the ogre; that is, an ogre with a handkerchief.  Most knights

would have thought of nothing but getting his armor; but so I got

his bandanna, he could keep his hardware, for all of me.



Meantime, it was getting hotter and hotter in there.  You see,

the sun was beating down and warming up the iron more and more

all the time.  Well, when you are hot, that way, every little thing

irritates you.  When I trotted, I rattled like a crate of dishes,

and that annoyed me; and moreover I couldn't seem to stand that

shield slatting and banging, now about my breast, now around my

back; and if I dropped into a walk my joints creaked and screeched

in that wearisome way that a wheelbarrow does, and as we didn't

create any breeze at that gait, I was like to get fried in that

stove; and besides, the quieter you went the heavier the iron

settled down on you and the more and more tons you seemed to weigh

every minute.  And you had to be always changing hands, and passing

your spear over to the other foot, it got so irksome for one hand

to hold it long at a time.



Well, you know, when you perspire that way, in rivers, there comes

a time when you--when you--well, when you itch.  You are inside,

your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron between.

It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may.  First it is one

place; then another; then some more; and it goes on spreading and

spreading, and at last the territory is all occupied, and nobody

can imagine what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is.  And

when it had got to the worst, and it seemed to me that I could

not stand anything more, a fly got in through the bars and settled

on my nose, and the bars were stuck and wouldn't work, and I

couldn't get the visor up; and I could only shake my head, which

was baking hot by this time, and the fly--well, you know how a fly

acts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enough

to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz

all around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a way

that a person, already so distressed as I was, simply could not

stand.  So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and

relieve me of it.  Then she emptied the conveniences out of it

and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up, and

she poured the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how

refreshing it was.  She continued to fetch and pour until I was

well soaked and thoroughly comfortable.



It was good to have a rest--and peace.  But nothing is quite

perfect in this life, at any time.  I had made a pipe a while back,

and also some pretty fair tobacco; not the real thing, but what

some of the Indians use: the inside bark of the willow, dried.

These comforts had been in the helmet, and now I had them again,

but no matches.



Gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in

upon my understanding--that we were weather-bound.  An armed novice

cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it.  Sandy was

not enough; not enough for me, anyway.  We had to wait until

somebody should come along.  Waiting, in silence, would have been

agreeable enough, for I was full of matter for reflection, and

wanted to give it a chance to work.  I wanted to try and think out

how it was that rational or even half-rational men could ever

have learned to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; and

how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations

when it was plain that what I had suffered to-day they had had

to suffer all the days of their lives.  I wanted to think that out;

and moreover I wanted to think out some way to reform this evil

and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but

thinking was out of the question in the circumstances.  You couldn't

think, where Sandy was.



She was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had

a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill, and made your head

sore like the drays and wagons in a city.  If she had had a cork

she would have been a comfort.  But you can't cork that kind;

they would die.  Her clack was going all day, and you would think

something would surely happen to her works, by and by; but no,

they never got out of order; and she never had to slack up for

words.  She could grind, and pump, and churn, and buzz by the week,

and never stop to oil up or blow out.  And yet the result was just

nothing but wind.  She never had any ideas, any more than a fog

has.  She was a perfect blatherskite; I mean for jaw, jaw, jaw,

talk, talk, talk, jabber, jabber, jabber; but just as good as she

could be.  I hadn't minded her mill that morning, on account of

having that hornets' nest of other troubles; but more than once

in the afternoon I had to say:



"Take a rest, child; the way you are using up all the domestic air,

the kingdom will have to go to importing it by to-morrow, and it's

a low enough treasury without that."







CHAPTER XIII



FREEMEN



Yes, it is strange how little a while at a time a person can be

contented.  Only a little while back, when I was riding and

suffering, what a heaven this peace, this rest, this sweet serenity

in this secluded shady nook by this purling stream would have

seemed, where I could keep perfectly comfortable all the time

by pouring a dipper of water into my armor now and then; yet

already I was getting dissatisfied; partly because I could not

light my pipe--for, although I had long ago started a match factory,

I had forgotten to bring matches with me--and partly because we

had nothing to eat.  Here was another illustration of the childlike

improvidence of this age and people.  A man in armor always trusted

to chance for his food on a journey, and would have been scandalized

at the idea of hanging a basket of sandwiches on his spear.  There

was probably not a knight of all the Round Table combination who

would not rather have died than been caught carrying such a thing

as that on his flagstaff.  And yet there could not be anything more

sensible.  It had been my intention to smuggle a couple of sandwiches

into my helmet, but I was interrupted in the act, and had to make

an excuse and lay them aside, and a dog got them.



Night approached, and with it a storm.  The darkness came on fast.

We must camp, of course.  I found a good shelter for the demoiselle

under a rock, and went off and found another for myself.  But

I was obliged to remain in my armor, because I could not get it off

by myself and yet could not allow Alisande to help, because it

would have seemed so like undressing before folk.  It would not

have amounted to that in reality, because I had clothes on

underneath; but the prejudices of one's breeding are not gotten

rid of just at a jump, and I knew that when it came to stripping

off that bob-tailed iron petticoat I should be embarrassed.



With the storm came a change of weather; and the stronger the wind

blew, and the wilder the rain lashed around, the colder and colder

it got.  Pretty soon, various kinds of bugs and ants and worms

and things began to flock in out of the wet and crawl down inside

my armor to get warm; and while some of them behaved well enough,

and snuggled up amongst my clothes and got quiet, the majority

were of a restless, uncomfortable sort, and never stayed still,

but went on prowling and hunting for they did not know what;

especially the ants, which went tickling along in wearisome

procession from one end of me to the other by the hour, and are

a kind of creatures which I never wish to sleep with again.

It would be my advice to persons situated in this way, to not roll

or thrash around, because this excites the interest of all the

different sorts of animals and makes every last one of them want

to turn out and see what is going on, and this makes things worse

than they were before, and of course makes you objurgate harder,

too, if you can.  Still, if one did not roll and thrash around

he would die; so perhaps it is as well to do one way as the other;

there is no real choice.  Even after I was frozen solid I could

still distinguish that tickling, just as a corpse does when he is

taking electric treatment.  I said I would never wear armor

after this trip.



All those trying hours whilst I was frozen and yet was in a living

fire, as you may say, on account of that swarm of crawlers, that

same unanswerable question kept circling and circling through my

tired head: How do people stand this miserable armor?  How have

they managed to stand it all these generations?  How can they sleep

at night for dreading the tortures of next day?



When the morning came at last, I was in a bad enough plight: seedy,

drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around,

famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid of

the animals; and crippled with rheumatism.  And how had it fared

with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the Demoiselle Alisande

la Carteloise?  Why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept

like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any

other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not

missing it.  Measured by modern standards, they were merely modified

savages, those people.  This noble lady showed no impatience to get

to breakfast--and that smacks of the savage, too.  On their journeys

those Britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them;

and also how to freight up against probable fasts before starting,

after the style of the Indian and the anaconda.  As like as not,

Sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch.



We were off before sunrise, Sandy riding and I limping along

behind.  In half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor

creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded

as a road.  They were as humble as animals to me; and when I

proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so

overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that

at first they were not able to believe that I was in earnest.

My lady put up her scornful lip and withdrew to one side; she said

in their hearing that she would as soon think of eating with the

other cattle--a remark which embarrassed these poor devils merely

because it referred to them, and not because it insulted or offended

them, for it didn't.  And yet they were not slaves, not chattels.

By a sarcasm of law and phrase they were freemen.  Seven-tenths

of the free population of the country were of just their class and

degree: small "independent" farmers, artisans, etc.; which is

to say, they were the nation, the actual Nation; they were about

all of it that was useful, or worth saving, or really respect-worthy,

and to subtract them would have been to subtract the Nation and

leave behind some dregs, some refuse, in the shape of a king,

nobility and gentry, idle, unproductive, acquainted mainly with

the arts of wasting and destroying, and of no sort of use or value

in any rationally constructed world.  And yet, by ingenious

contrivance, this gilded minority, instead of being in the tail

of the procession where it belonged, was marching head up and

banners flying, at the other end of it; had elected itself to be

the Nation, and these innumerable clams had permitted it so long

that they had come at last to accept it as a truth; and not only

that, but to believe it right and as it should be.  The priests

had told their fathers and themselves that this ironical state

of things was ordained of God; and so, not reflecting upon how

unlike God it would be to amuse himself with sarcasms, and especially

such poor transparent ones as this, they had dropped the matter

there and become respectfully quiet.



The talk of these meek people had a strange enough sound in

a formerly American ear.  They were freemen, but they could not

leave the estates of their lord or their bishop without his

permission; they could not prepare their own bread, but must have

their corn ground and their bread baked at his mill and his bakery,

and pay roundly for the same; they could not sell a piece of their

own property without paying him a handsome percentage of the

proceeds, nor buy a piece of somebody else's without remembering

him in cash for the privilege; they had to harvest his grain for him

gratis, and be ready to come at a moment's notice, leaving their

own crop to destruction by the threatened storm; they had to let

him plant fruit trees in their fields, and then keep their indignation

to themselves when his heedless fruit-gatherers trampled the grain

around the trees; they had to smother their anger when his hunting

parties galloped through their fields laying waste the result of

their patient toil; they were not allowed to keep doves themselves,

and when the swarms from my lord's dovecote settled on their crops

they must not lose their temper and kill a bird, for awful would

the penalty be; when the harvest was at last gathered, then came

the procession of robbers to levy their blackmail upon it: first

the Church carted off its fat tenth, then the king's commissioner

took his twentieth, then my lord's people made a mighty inroad

upon the remainder; after which, the skinned freeman had liberty

to bestow the remnant in his barn, in case it was worth the trouble;

there were taxes, and taxes, and taxes, and more taxes, and taxes

again, and yet other taxes--upon this free and independent pauper,

but none upon his lord the baron or the bishop, none upon the

wasteful nobility or the all-devouring Church; if the baron would

sleep unvexed, the freeman must sit up all night after his day's

work and whip the ponds to keep the frogs quiet; if the freeman's

daughter--but no, that last infamy of monarchical government is

unprintable; and finally, if the freeman, grown desperate with his

tortures, found his life unendurable under such conditions, and

sacrificed it and fled to death for mercy and refuge, the gentle

Church condemned him to eternal fire, the gentle law buried him

at midnight at the cross-roads with a stake through his back,

and his master the baron or the bishop confiscated all his property

and turned his widow and his orphans out of doors.



And here were these freemen assembled in the early morning to work

on their lord the bishop's road three days each--gratis; every

head of a family, and every son of a family, three days each,

gratis, and a day or so added for their servants.  Why, it was

like reading about France and the French, before the ever memorable

and blessed Revolution, which swept a thousand years of such

villany away in one swift tidal-wave of blood--one: a settlement

of that hoary debt in the proportion of half a drop of blood for

each hogshead of it that had been pressed by slow tortures out of

that people in the weary stretch of ten centuries of wrong and

shame and misery the like of which was not to be mated but in hell.

There were two "Reigns of Terror," if we would but remember it

and consider it; the one wrought murder in hot passion, the other

in heartless cold blood; the one lasted mere months, the other had

lasted a thousand years; the one inflicted death upon ten thousand

persons, the other upon a hundred millions; but our shudders are

all for the "horrors" of the minor Terror, the momentary Terror,

so to speak; whereas, what is the horror of swift death by the axe,

compared with lifelong death from hunger, cold, insult, cruelty,

and heart-break?  What is swift death by lightning compared with

death by slow fire at the stake?  A city cemetery could contain the

coffins filled by that brief Terror which we have all been so

diligently taught to shiver at and mourn over; but all France could

hardly contain the coffins filled by that older and real Terror

--that unspeakably bitter and awful Terror which none of us has

been taught to see in its vastness or pity as it deserves.



These poor ostensible freemen who were sharing their breakfast

and their talk with me, were as full of humble reverence for their

king and Church and nobility as their worst enemy could desire.

There was something pitifully ludicrous about it.  I asked them

if they supposed a nation of people ever existed, who, with a free

vote in every man's hand, would elect that a single family and its

descendants should reign over it forever, whether gifted or boobies,

to the exclusion of all other families--including the voter's; and

would also elect that a certain hundred families should be raised

to dizzy summits of rank, and clothed on with offensive transmissible

glories and privileges to the exclusion of the rest of the nation's

families--_including his own_.



They all looked unhit, and said they didn't know; that they had

never thought about it before, and it hadn't ever occurred to them

that a nation could be so situated that every man _could_ have

a say in the government.  I said I had seen one--and that it would

last until it had an Established Church.  Again they were all

unhit--at first.  But presently one man looked up and asked me

to state that proposition again; and state it slowly, so it could

soak into his understanding.  I did it; and after a little he had

the idea, and he brought his fist down and said _he_ didn't believe

a nation where every man had a vote would voluntarily get down

in the mud and dirt in any such way; and that to steal from a nation

its will and preference must be a crime and the first of all crimes.

I said to myself:



"This one's a man.  If I were backed by enough of his sort, I would

make a strike for the welfare of this country, and try to prove

myself its loyalest citizen by making a wholesome change in its

system of government."



You see my kind of loyalty was loyalty to one's country, not to

its institutions or its office-holders.  The country is the real

thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing; it is the thing

to watch over, and care for, and be loyal to; institutions are

extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out,

become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body

from winter, disease, and death.  To be loyal to rags, to shout

for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags--that is a loyalty

of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy, was invented

by monarchy; let monarchy keep it.  I was from Connecticut, whose

Constitution declares "that all political power is inherent in

the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority

and instituted for their benefit; and that they have _at all times_

an undeniable and indefeasible right to _alter their form of

government_ in such a manner as they may think expedient."



Under that gospel, the citizen who thinks he sees that the

commonwealth's political clothes are worn out, and yet holds his

peace and does not agitate for a new suit, is disloyal; he is

a traitor.  That he may be the only one who thinks he sees this

decay, does not excuse him; it is his duty to agitate anyway, and

it is the duty of the others to vote him down if they do not see

the matter as he does.



And now here I was, in a country where a right to say how the

country should be governed was restricted to six persons in each

thousand of its population.  For the nine hundred and ninety-four

to express dissatisfaction with the regnant system and propose

to change it, would have made the whole six shudder as one man,

it would have been so disloyal, so dishonorable, such putrid black

treason.  So to speak, I was become a stockholder in a corporation

where nine hundred and ninety-four of the members furnished all

the money and did all the work, and the other six elected themselves

a permanent board of direction and took all the dividends.  It seemed

to me that what the nine hundred and ninety-four dupes needed was

a new deal.  The thing that would have best suited the circus side

of my nature would have been to resign the Boss-ship and get up

an insurrection and turn it into a revolution; but I knew that the

Jack Cade or the Wat Tyler who tries such a thing without first

educating his materials up to revolution grade is almost absolutely

certain to get left.  I had never been accustomed to getting left,

even if I do say it myself.  Wherefore, the "deal" which had been

for some time working into shape in my mind was of a quite different

pattern from the Cade-Tyler sort.



So I did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat

munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human

sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him.

After I had finished, I got him to lend me a little ink from his

veins; and with this and a sliver I wrote on a piece of bark--



   Put him in the Man-factory--



and gave it to him, and said:



"Take it to the palace at Camelot and give it into the hands of

Amyas le Poulet, whom I call Clarence, and he will understand."



"He is a priest, then," said the man, and some of the enthusiasm

went out of his face.



"How--a priest?  Didn't I tell you that no chattel of the Church,

no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my Man-Factory?  Didn't

I tell you that _you_ couldn't enter unless your religion, whatever

it might be, was your own free property?"



"Marry, it is so, and for that I was glad; wherefore it liked me not,

and bred in me a cold doubt, to hear of this priest being there."



"But he isn't a priest, I tell you."



The man looked far from satisfied.  He said:



"He is not a priest, and yet can read?"



"He is not a priest and yet can read--yes, and write, too, for that

matter.  I taught him myself." The man's face cleared.  "And it is

the first thing that you yourself will be taught in that Factory--"



"I?  I would give blood out of my heart to know that art.  Why,

I will be your slave, your--"



"No you won't, you won't be anybody's slave.  Take your family

and go along.  Your lord the bishop will confiscate your small

property, but no matter.  Clarence will fix you all right."







CHAPTER XIV



"DEFEND THEE, LORD"



I paid three pennies for my breakfast, and a most extravagant

price it was, too, seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen

persons for that money; but I was feeling good by this time, and

I had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway; and then these

people had wanted to give me the food for nothing, scant as

their provision was, and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize

my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a good big financial

lift where the money would do so much more good than it would

in my helmet, where, these pennies being made of iron and not

stinted in weight, my half-dollar's worth was a good deal of a

burden to me.  I spent money rather too freely in those days,

it is true; but one reason for it was that I hadn't got the

proportions of things entirely adjusted, even yet, after so long

a sojourn in Britain--hadn't got along to where I was able to

absolutely realize that a penny in Arthur's land and a couple of

dollars in Connecticut were about one and the same thing: just

twins, as you may say, in purchasing power.  If my start from

Camelot could have been delayed a very few days I could have paid

these people in beautiful new coins from our own mint, and that

would have pleased me; and them, too, not less.  I had adopted

the American values exclusively.  In a week or two now, cents,

nickels, dimes, quarters, and half-dollars, and also a trifle of

gold, would be trickling in thin but steady streams all through

the commercial veins of the kingdom, and I looked to see this

new blood freshen up its life.



The farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset

my liberality, whether I would or no; so I let them give me a flint

and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed Sandy

and me on our horse, I lit my pipe.  When the first blast of smoke

shot out through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke

for the woods, and Sandy went over backwards and struck the ground

with a dull thud.  They thought I was one of those fire-belching

dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other

professional liars.  I had infinite trouble to persuade those people

to venture back within explaining distance.  Then I told them that

this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none

but my enemies.  And I promised, with my hand on my heart, that

if all who felt no enmity toward me would come forward and pass

before me they should see that only those who remained behind would

be struck dead.  The procession moved with a good deal of promptness.

There were no casualties to report, for nobody had curiosity enough

to remain behind to see what would happen.



I lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone,

became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks

that I had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before

they would let me go.  Still the delay was not wholly unproductive,

for it took all that time to get Sandy thoroughly wonted to the new

thing, she being so close to it, you know.  It plugged up her

conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, and that was

a gain.  But above all other benefits accruing, I had learned

something.  I was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come

along, now.



We tarried with a holy hermit, that night, and my opportunity

came about the middle of the next afternoon.  We were crossing

a vast meadow by way of short-cut, and I was musing absently,

hearing nothing, seeing nothing, when Sandy suddenly interrupted

a remark which she had begun that morning, with the cry:



"Defend thee, lord!--peril of life is toward!"



And she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood.

I looked up and saw, far off in the shade of a tree, half a dozen

armed knights and their squires; and straightway there was bustle

among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.  My pipe

was ready and would have been lit, if I had not been lost in

thinking about how to banish oppression from this land and restore

to all its people their stolen rights and manhood without disobliging

anybody.  I lit up at once, and by the time I had got a good head

of reserved steam on, here they came.  All together, too; none of

those chivalrous magnanimities which one reads so much about

--one courtly rascal at a time, and the rest standing by to see fair

play.  No, they came in a body, they came with a whirr and a rush,

they came like a volley from a battery; came with heads low down,

plumes streaming out behind, lances advanced at a level.  It was

a handsome sight, a beautiful sight--for a man up a tree.  I laid

my lance in rest and waited, with my heart beating, till the iron

wave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column of

white smoke through the bars of my helmet.  You should have seen

the wave go to pieces and scatter!  This was a finer sight than

the other one.



But these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, and

this troubled me.  My satisfaction collapsed, and fear came;

I judged I was a lost man.  But Sandy was radiant; and was going

to be eloquent--but I stopped her, and told her my magic had

miscarried, somehow or other, and she must mount, with all despatch,

and we must ride for life.  No, she wouldn't.  She said that my

enchantment had disabled those knights; they were not riding on,

because they couldn't; wait, they would drop out of their saddles

presently, and we would get their horses and harness.  I could not

deceive such trusting simplicity, so I said it was a mistake; that

when my fireworks killed at all, they killed instantly; no, the men

would not die, there was something wrong about my apparatus,

I couldn't tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those

people would attack us again, in a minute.  Sandy laughed, and said:



"Lack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!  Sir Launcelot will

give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail

them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer

and destroy them; and so likewise will Sir Pellinore and Sir Aglovale

and Sir Carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that

will venture it, let the idle say what the idle will.  And, la,

as to yonder base rufflers, think ye they have not their fill,

but yet desire more?"



"Well, then, what are they waiting for?  Why don't they leave?

Nobody's hindering.  Good land, I'm willing to let bygones be

bygones, I'm sure."



"Leave, is it?  Oh, give thyself easement as to that.  They dream

not of it, no, not they.  They wait to yield them."



"Come--really, is that 'sooth'--as you people say?  If they want to,

why don't they?"



"It would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed,

ye would not hold them blamable. They fear to come."



"Well, then, suppose I go to them instead, and--"



"Ah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming.  I will go."



And she did.  She was a handy person to have along on a raid.

I would have considered this a doubtful errand, myself.  I presently

saw the knights riding away, and Sandy coming back.  That was

a relief.  I judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings

--I mean in the conversation; otherwise the interview wouldn't have

been so short.  But it turned out that she had managed the business

well; in fact, admirably.  She said that when she told those people

I was The Boss, it hit them where they lived: "smote them sore

with fear and dread" was her word; and then they were ready to

put up with anything she might require.  So she swore them to appear

at Arthur's court within two days and yield them, with horse and

harness, and be my knights henceforth, and subject to my command.

How much better she managed that thing than I should have done

it myself!  She was a daisy.







CHAPTER XV



SANDY'S TALE



"And so I'm proprietor of some knights," said I, as we rode off.

"Who would ever have supposed that I should live to list up assets

of that sort.  I shan't know what to do with them; unless I raffle

them off.  How many of them are there, Sandy?"



"Seven, please you, sir, and their squires."



"It is a good haul.  Who are they?  Where do they hang out?"



"Where do they hang out?"



"Yes, where do they live?"



"Ah, I understood thee not.  That will I tell eftsoons."  Then she

said musingly, and softly, turning the words daintily over her

tongue: "Hang they out--hang they out--where hang--where do they

hang out; eh, right so; where do they hang out.  Of a truth the

phrase hath a fair and winsome grace, and is prettily worded

withal.  I will repeat it anon and anon in mine idlesse, whereby

I may peradventure learn it.  Where do they hang out.  Even so!

already it falleth trippingly from my tongue, and forasmuch as--"



"Don't forget the cowboys, Sandy."



"Cowboys?"



"Yes; the knights, you know: You were going to tell me about them.

A while back, you remember.  Figuratively speaking, game's called."



"Game--"



"Yes, yes, yes!  Go to the bat.  I mean, get to work on your

statistics, and don't burn so much kindling getting your fire

started.  Tell me about the knights."



"I will well, and lightly will begin.  So they two departed and

rode into a great forest.  And--"



"Great Scott!"



You see, I recognized my mistake at once.  I had set her works

a-going; it was my own fault; she would be thirty days getting down

to those facts.  And she generally began without a preface and

finished without a result.  If you interrupted her she would either

go right along without noticing, or answer with a couple of words,

and go back and say the sentence over again.  So, interruptions

only did harm; and yet I had to interrupt, and interrupt pretty

frequently, too, in order to save my life; a person would die if

he let her monotony drip on him right along all day.



"Great Scott!" I said in my distress.  She went right back and

began over again:



"So they two departed and rode into a great forest.  And--"



"_Which_ two?"



"Sir Gawaine and Sir Uwaine.  And so they came to an abbey of monks,

and there were well lodged.  So on the morn they heard their masses

in the abbey, and so they rode forth till they came to a great

forest; then was Sir Gawaine ware in a valley by a turret, of

twelve fair damsels, and two knights armed on great horses, and

the damsels went to and fro by a tree.  And then was Sir Gawaine

ware how there hung a white shield on that tree, and ever as the

damsels came by it they spit upon it, and some threw mire upon

the shield--"



"Now, if I hadn't seen the like myself in this country, Sandy,

I wouldn't believe it.  But I've seen it, and I can just see those

creatures now, parading before that shield and acting like that.

The women here do certainly act like all possessed.  Yes, and

I mean your best, too, society's very choicest brands.  The humblest

hello-girl along ten thousand miles of wire could teach gentleness,

patience, modesty, manners, to the highest duchess in Arthur's land."



"Hello-girl?"



"Yes, but don't you ask me to explain; it's a new kind of a girl;

they don't have them here; one often speaks sharply to them when

they are not the least in fault, and he can't get over feeling

sorry for it and ashamed of himself in thirteen hundred years,

it's such shabby mean conduct and so unprovoked; the fact is,

no gentleman ever does it--though I--well, I myself, if I've got

to confess--"



"Peradventure she--"



"Never mind her; never mind her; I tell you I couldn't ever explain

her so you would understand."



"Even so be it, sith ye are so minded.  Then Sir Gawaine and

Sir Uwaine went and saluted them, and asked them why they did that

despite to the shield.  Sirs, said the damsels, we shall tell you.

There is a knight in this country that owneth this white shield,

and he is a passing good man of his hands, but he hateth all

ladies and gentlewomen, and therefore we do all this despite to

the shield.  I will say you, said Sir Gawaine, it beseemeth evil

a good knight to despise all ladies and gentlewomen, and peradventure

though he hate you he hath some cause, and peradventure he loveth

in some other places ladies and gentlewomen, and to be loved again,

and he such a man of prowess as ye speak of--"



"Man of prowess--yes, that is the man to please them, Sandy.

Man of brains--that is a thing they never think of.  Tom Sayers

--John Heenan--John L. Sullivan--pity but you could be here.  You

would have your legs under the Round Table and a 'Sir' in front

of your names within the twenty-four hours; and you could bring

about a new distribution of the married princesses and duchesses

of the Court in another twenty-four.  The fact is, it is just

a sort of polished-up court of Comanches, and there isn't a squaw

in it who doesn't stand ready at the dropping of a hat to desert

to the buck with the biggest string of scalps at his belt."



"--and he be such a man of prowess as ye speak of, said Sir Gawaine.

Now, what is his name?  Sir, said they, his name is Marhaus the

king's son of Ireland."



"Son of the king of Ireland, you mean; the other form doesn't mean

anything.  And look out and hold on tight, now, we must jump

this gully....  There, we are all right now.  This horse belongs in

the circus; he is born before his time."



"I know him well, said Sir Uwaine, he is a passing good knight as

any is on live."



"_On live_.  If you've got a fault in the world, Sandy, it is that

you are a shade too archaic.  But it isn't any matter."



"--for I saw him once proved at a justs where many knights were

gathered, and that time there might no man withstand him.  Ah, said

Sir Gawaine, damsels, methinketh ye are to blame, for it is to

suppose he that hung that shield there will not be long therefrom,

and then may those knights match him on horseback, and that is

more your worship than thus; for I will abide no longer to see

a knight's shield dishonored.  And therewith Sir Uwaine and

Sir Gawaine departed a little from them, and then were they ware

where Sir Marhaus came riding on a great horse straight toward

them.  And when the twelve damsels saw Sir Marhaus they fled into

the turret as they were wild, so that some of them fell by the way.

Then the one of the knights of the tower dressed his shield, and

said on high, Sir Marhaus defend thee.  And so they ran together

that the knight brake his spear on Marhaus, and Sir Marhaus smote

him so hard that he brake his neck and the horse's back--"



"Well, that is just the trouble about this state of things,

it ruins so many horses."



"That saw the other knight of the turret, and dressed him toward

Marhaus, and they went so eagerly together, that the knight of

the turret was soon smitten down, horse and man, stark dead--"



"_Another_ horse gone; I tell you it is a custom that ought to be

broken up.  I don't see how people with any feeling can applaud

and support it."



    .   .   .   .



"So these two knights came together with great random--"



I saw that I had been asleep and missed a chapter, but I didn't

say anything.  I judged that the Irish knight was in trouble with

the visitors by this time, and this turned out to be the case.



"--that Sir Uwaine smote Sir Marhaus that his spear brast in pieces

on the shield, and Sir Marhaus smote him so sore that horse and

man he bare to the earth, and hurt Sir Uwaine on the left side--"



"The truth is, Alisande, these archaics are a little _too_ simple;

the vocabulary is too limited, and so, by consequence, descriptions

suffer in the matter of variety; they run too much to level Saharas

of fact, and not enough to picturesque detail; this throws about

them a certain air of the monotonous; in fact the fights are all

alike: a couple of people come together with great random

--random is a good word, and so is exegesis, for that matter, and

so is holocaust, and defalcation, and usufruct and a hundred others,

but land! a body ought to discriminate--they come together with

great random, and a spear is brast, and one party brake his shield

and the other one goes down, horse and man, over his horse-tail

and brake his neck, and then the next candidate comes randoming in,

and brast _his_ spear, and the other man brast his shield, and down

_he_ goes, horse and man, over his horse-tail, and brake _his_ neck,

and then there's another elected, and another and another and still

another, till the material is all used up; and when you come to

figure up results, you can't tell one fight from another, nor who

whipped; and as a _picture_, of living, raging, roaring battle,

sho! why, it's pale and noiseless--just ghosts scuffling in a fog.

Dear me, what would this barren vocabulary get out of the mightiest

spectacle?--the burning of Rome in Nero's time, for instance?

Why, it would merely say, 'Town burned down; no insurance; boy

brast a window, fireman brake his neck!'  Why, _that_ ain't a picture!"



It was a good deal of a lecture, I thought, but it didn't disturb

Sandy, didn't turn a feather; her steam soared steadily up again,

the minute I took off the lid:



"Then Sir Marhaus turned his horse and rode toward Gawaine with

his spear.  And when Sir Gawaine saw that, he dressed his shield,

and they aventred their spears, and they came together with all

the might of their horses, that either knight smote other so hard

in the midst of their shields, but Sir Gawaine's spear brake--"



"I knew it would."



--"but Sir Marhaus's spear held; and therewith Sir Gawaine and

his horse rushed down to the earth--"



"Just so--and brake his back."



--"and lightly Sir Gawaine rose upon his feet and pulled out

his sword, and dressed him toward Sir Marhaus on foot, and therewith

either came unto other eagerly, and smote together with their

swords, that their shields flew in cantels, and they bruised their

helms and their hauberks, and wounded either other.  But Sir Gawaine,

fro it passed nine of the clock, waxed by the space of three hours

ever stronger and stronger and thrice his might was increased.

All this espied Sir Marhaus, and had great wonder how his might

increased, and so they wounded other passing sore; and then when

it was come noon--"



The pelting sing-song of it carried me forward to scenes and

sounds of my boyhood days:



"N-e-e-ew Haven! ten minutes for refreshments--knductr'll strike

the gong-bell two minutes before train leaves--passengers for

the Shore line please take seats in the rear k'yar, this k'yar

don't go no furder--_ahh_-pls, _aw_-rnjz, b'_nan_ners,

_s-a-n-d-'ches, p--_op_-corn!"



--"and waxed past noon and drew toward evensong.  Sir Gawaine's

strength feebled and waxed passing faint, that unnethes he might

dure any longer, and Sir Marhaus was then bigger and bigger--"



"Which strained his armor, of course; and yet little would one

of these people mind a small thing like that."



--"and so, Sir Knight, said Sir Marhaus, I have well felt that

ye are a passing good knight, and a marvelous man of might as ever

I felt any, while it lasteth, and our quarrels are not great, and

therefore it were a pity to do you hurt, for I feel you are passing

feeble.  Ah, said Sir Gawaine, gentle knight, ye say the word

that I should say.  And therewith they took off their helms and

either kissed other, and there they swore together either to love

other as brethren--"



But I lost the thread there, and dozed off to slumber, thinking

about what a pity it was that men with such superb strength

--strength enabling them to stand up cased in cruelly burdensome

iron and drenched with perspiration, and hack and batter and bang

each other for six hours on a stretch--should not have been born

at a time when they could put it to some useful purpose.  Take

a jackass, for instance: a jackass has that kind of strength, and

puts it to a useful purpose, and is valuable to this world because

he is a jackass; but a nobleman is not valuable because he is

a jackass.  It is a mixture that is always ineffectual, and should

never have been attempted in the first place.  And yet, once you

start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never know what is

going to come of it.



When I came to myself again and began to listen, I perceived that

I had lost another chapter, and that Alisande had wandered a long

way off with her people.



"And so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones,

and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was

the head of the stream, a fair fountain, and three damsels sitting

thereby. In this country, said Sir Marhaus, came never knight

since it was christened, but he found strange adventures--"



"This is not good form, Alisande.  Sir Marhaus the king's son of

Ireland talks like all the rest; you ought to give him a brogue,

or at least a characteristic expletive; by this means one would

recognize him as soon as he spoke, without his ever being named.

It is a common literary device with the great authors.  You should

make him say, 'In this country, be jabers, came never knight since

it was christened, but he found strange adventures, be jabers.'

You see how much better that sounds."



--"came never knight but he found strange adventures, be jabers.

Of a truth it doth indeed, fair lord, albeit 'tis passing hard

to say, though peradventure that will not tarry but better speed

with usage.  And then they rode to the damsels, and either saluted

other, and the eldest had a garland of gold about her head, and

she was threescore winter of age or more--"



"The _damsel_ was?"



"Even so, dear lord--and her hair was white under the garland--"



"Celluloid teeth, nine dollars a set, as like as not--the loose-fit

kind, that go up and down like a portcullis when you eat, and

fall out when you laugh."



"The second damsel was of thirty winter of age, with a circlet of

gold about her head.  The third damsel was but fifteen year of age--"



Billows of thought came rolling over my soul, and the voice faded

out of my hearing!



Fifteen!  Break--my heart! oh, my lost darling!  Just her age

who was so gentle, and lovely, and all the world to me, and whom

I shall never see again!  How the thought of her carries me back

over wide seas of memory to a vague dim time, a happy time, so many,

many centuries hence, when I used to wake in the soft summer

mornings, out of sweet dreams of her, and say "Hello, Central!"

just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a

"Hello, Hank!" that was music of the spheres to my enchanted ear.

She got three dollars a week, but she was worth it.



I could not follow Alisande's further explanation of who our

captured knights were, now--I mean in case she should ever get

to explaining who they were.  My interest was gone, my thoughts

were far away, and sad.  By fitful glimpses of the drifting tale,

caught here and there and now and then, I merely noted in a vague

way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels

up behind him on his horse, and one rode north, another east,

the other south, to seek adventures, and meet again and lie, after

year and day.  Year and day--and without baggage.  It was of

a piece with the general simplicity of the country.



The sun was now setting.  It was about three in the afternoon when

Alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were; so she had made

pretty good progress with it--for her.  She would arrive some time

or other, no doubt, but she was not a person who could be hurried.



We were approaching a castle which stood on high ground; a huge,

strong, venerable structure, whose gray towers and battlements were

charmingly draped with ivy, and whose whole majestic mass was

drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun.  It was the

largest castle we had seen, and so I thought it might be the one

we were after, but Sandy said no.  She did not know who owned it;

she said she had passed it without calling, when she went down

to Camelot.







CHAPTER XVI



MORGAN LE FAY



If knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable

places to seek hospitality in.  As a matter of fact, knights errant

were _not_ persons to be believed--that is, measured by modern

standards of veracity; yet, measured by the standards of their own

time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth.  It was very

simple: you discounted a statement ninety-seven per cent; the rest

was fact.  Now after making this allowance, the truth remained

that if I could find out something about a castle before ringing

the door-bell--I mean hailing the warders--it was the sensible

thing to do.  So I was pleased when I saw in the distance a horseman

making the bottom turn of the road that wound down from this castle.



As we approached each other, I saw that he wore a plumed helmet,

and seemed to be otherwise clothed in steel, but bore a curious

addition also--a stiff square garment like a herald's tabard.

However, I had to smile at my own forgetfulness when I got nearer

and read this sign on his tabard:



  "Persimmon's Soap -- All the Prime-Donna Use It."



That was a little idea of my own, and had several wholesome purposes

in view toward the civilizing and uplifting of this nation.  In the

first place, it was a furtive, underhand blow at this nonsense

of knight errantry, though nobody suspected that but me.  I had

started a number of these people out--the bravest knights I could

get--each sandwiched between bulletin-boards bearing one device

or another, and I judged that by and by when they got to be numerous

enough they would begin to look ridiculous; and then, even the

steel-clad ass that _hadn't_ any board would himself begin to look

ridiculous because he was out of the fashion.



Secondly, these missionaries would gradually, and without creating

suspicion or exciting alarm, introduce a rudimentary cleanliness

among the nobility, and from them it would work down to the people,

if the priests could be kept quiet.  This would undermine the Church.

I mean would be a step toward that.  Next, education--next, freedom

--and then she would begin to crumble.  It being my conviction that

any Established Church is an established crime, an established

slave-pen, I had no scruples, but was willing to assail it in

any way or with any weapon that promised to hurt it.  Why, in my

own former day--in remote centuries not yet stirring in the womb

of time--there were old Englishmen who imagined that they had been

born in a free country: a "free" country with the Corporation Act

and the Test still in force in it--timbers propped against men's

liberties and dishonored consciences to shore up an Established

Anachronism with.



My missionaries were taught to spell out the gilt signs on their

tabards--the showy gilding was a neat idea, I could have got the

king to wear a bulletin-board for the sake of that barbaric

splendor--they were to spell out these signs and then explain to

the lords and ladies what soap was; and if the lords and ladies

were afraid of it, get them to try it on a dog.  The missionary's

next move was to get the family together and try it on himself;

he was to stop at no experiment, however desperate, that could

convince the nobility that soap was harmless; if any final doubt

remained, he must catch a hermit--the woods were full of them;

saints they called themselves, and saints they were believed to be.

They were unspeakably holy, and worked miracles, and everybody

stood in awe of them.  If a hermit could survive a wash, and that

failed to convince a duke, give him up, let him alone.



Whenever my missionaries overcame a knight errant on the road

they washed him, and when he got well they swore him to go and

get a bulletin-board and disseminate soap and civilization the rest

of his days.  As a consequence the workers in the field were

increasing by degrees, and the reform was steadily spreading.

My soap factory felt the strain early.  At first I had only two

hands; but before I had left home I was already employing fifteen,

and running night and day; and the atmospheric result was getting

so pronounced that the king went sort of fainting and gasping

around and said he did not believe he could stand it much longer,

and Sir Launcelot got so that he did hardly anything but walk up

and down the roof and swear, although I told him it was worse up

there than anywhere else, but he said he wanted plenty of air; and

he was always complaining that a palace was no place for a soap

factory anyway, and said if a man was to start one in his house

he would be damned if he wouldn't strangle him.  There were ladies

present, too, but much these people ever cared for that; they would

swear before children, if the wind was their way when the factory

was going.



This missionary knight's name was La Cote Male Taile, and he said

that this castle was the abode of Morgan le Fay, sister of

King Arthur, and wife of King Uriens, monarch of a realm about

as big as the District of Columbia--you could stand in the middle

of it and throw bricks into the next kingdom.  "Kings" and "Kingdoms"

were as thick in Britain as they had been in little Palestine in

Joshua's time, when people had to sleep with their knees pulled up

because they couldn't stretch out without a passport.



La Cote was much depressed, for he had scored here the worst

failure of his campaign.  He had not worked off a cake; yet he had

tried all the tricks of the trade, even to the washing of a hermit;

but the hermit died.  This was, indeed, a bad failure, for this

animal would now be dubbed a martyr, and would take his place

among the saints of the Roman calendar.  Thus made he his moan,

this poor Sir La Cote Male Taile, and sorrowed passing sore.  And

so my heart bled for him, and I was moved to comfort and stay him.

Wherefore I said:



"Forbear to grieve, fair knight, for this is not a defeat.  We have

brains, you and I; and for such as have brains there are no defeats,

but only victories.  Observe how we will turn this seeming disaster

into an advertisement; an advertisement for our soap; and the

biggest one, to draw, that was ever thought of; an advertisement

that will transform that Mount Washington defeat into a Matterhorn

victory.  We will put on your bulletin-board, '_Patronized by the

elect_.'  How does that strike you?"



"Verily, it is wonderly bethought!"



"Well, a body is bound to admit that for just a modest little

one-line ad, it's a corker."



So the poor colporteur's griefs vanished away.  He was a brave

fellow, and had done mighty feats of arms in his time.  His chief

celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one

of mine, which he had once made with a damsel named Maledisant,

who was as handy with her tongue as was Sandy, though in a different

way, for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas

Sandy's music was of a kindlier sort.  I knew his story well, and so

I knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he

bade me farewell.  He supposed I was having a bitter hard time of it.



Sandy and I discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said

that La Cote's bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that

trip; for the king's fool had overthrown him on the first day,

and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the

conqueror, but Maledisant didn't do it; and also persisted afterward

in sticking to him, after all his defeats.  But, said I, suppose

the victor should decline to accept his spoil?  She said that that

wouldn't answer--he must.  He couldn't decline; it wouldn't be

regular.  I made a note of that.  If Sandy's music got to be too

burdensome, some time, I would let a knight defeat me, on the chance

that she would desert to him.



In due time we were challenged by the warders, from the castle

walls, and after a parley admitted.  I have nothing pleasant to

tell about that visit.  But it was not a disappointment, for I knew

Mrs. le Fay by reputation, and was not expecting anything pleasant.

She was held in awe by the whole realm, for she had made everybody

believe she was a great sorceress.  All her ways were wicked, all

her instincts devilish.  She was loaded to the eyelids with cold

malice.  All her history was black with crime; and among her crimes

murder was common.  I was most curious to see her; as curious as

I could have been to see Satan.  To my surprise she was beautiful;

black thoughts had failed to make her expression repulsive, age

had failed to wrinkle her satin skin or mar its bloomy freshness.

She could have passed for old Uriens' granddaughter, she could

have been mistaken for sister to her own son.



As soon as we were fairly within the castle gates we were ordered

into her presence.  King Uriens was there, a kind-faced old man

with a subdued look; and also the son, Sir Uwaine le Blanchemains,

in whom I was, of course, interested on account of the tradition

that he had once done battle with thirty knights, and also on

account of his trip with Sir Gawaine and Sir Marhaus, which Sandy

had been aging me with.  But Morgan was the main attraction, the

conspicuous personality here; she was head chief of this household,

that was plain.  She caused us to be seated, and then she began,

with all manner of pretty graces and graciousnesses, to ask me

questions.  Dear me, it was like a bird or a flute, or something,

talking.  I felt persuaded that this woman must have been

misrepresented, lied about.  She trilled along, and trilled along,

and presently a handsome young page, clothed like the rainbow, and

as easy and undulatory of movement as a wave, came with something

on a golden salver, and, kneeling to present it to her, overdid

his graces and lost his balance, and so fell lightly against her

knee.  She slipped a dirk into him in as matter-of-course a way as

another person would have harpooned a rat!



Poor child! he slumped to the floor, twisted his silken limbs in

one great straining contortion of pain, and was dead.  Out of the

old king was wrung an involuntary "O-h!" of compassion.  The look

he got, made him cut it suddenly short and not put any more hyphens

in it.  Sir Uwaine, at a sign from his mother, went to the anteroom

and called some servants, and meanwhile madame went rippling sweetly

along with her talk.



I saw that she was a good housekeeper, for while she talked she

kept a corner of her eye on the servants to see that they made

no balks in handling the body and getting it out; when they came

with fresh clean towels, she sent back for the other kind; and

when they had finished wiping the floor and were going, she indicated

a crimson fleck the size of a tear which their duller eyes had

overlooked.  It was plain to me that La Cote Male Taile had failed

to see the mistress of the house.  Often, how louder and clearer

than any tongue, does dumb circumstantial evidence speak.



Morgan le Fay rippled along as musically as ever.  Marvelous woman.

And what a glance she had: when it fell in reproof upon those

servants, they shrunk and quailed as timid people do when the

lightning flashes out of a cloud.  I could have got the habit

myself.  It was the same with that poor old Brer Uriens; he was

always on the ragged edge of apprehension; she could not even turn

toward him but he winced.



In the midst of the talk I let drop a complimentary word about

King Arthur, forgetting for the moment how this woman hated her

brother.  That one little compliment was enough.  She clouded up

like storm; she called for her guards, and said:



"Hale me these varlets to the dungeons."



That struck cold on my ears, for her dungeons had a reputation.

Nothing occurred to me to say--or do.  But not so with Sandy.

As the guard laid a hand upon me, she piped up with the tranquilest

confidence, and said:



"God's wounds, dost thou covet destruction, thou maniac?  It is

The Boss!"



Now what a happy idea that was!--and so simple; yet it would never

have occurred to me.  I was born modest; not all over, but in spots;

and this was one of the spots.



The effect upon madame was electrical.  It cleared her countenance

and brought back her smiles and all her persuasive graces and

blandishments; but nevertheless she was not able to entirely cover up

with them the fact that she was in a ghastly fright. She said:



"La, but do list to thine handmaid! as if one gifted with powers

like to mine might say the thing which I have said unto one who

has vanquished Merlin, and not be jesting.  By mine enchantments

I foresaw your coming, and by them I knew you when you entered

here.  I did but play this little jest with hope to surprise you

into some display of your art, as not doubting you would blast

the guards with occult fires, consuming them to ashes on the spot,

a marvel much beyond mine own ability, yet one which I have long

been childishly curious to see."



The guards were less curious, and got out as soon as they got permission.







CHAPTER XVII



A ROYAL BANQUET



Madame, seeing me pacific and unresentful, no doubt judged that

I was deceived by her excuse; for her fright dissolved away, and

she was soon so importunate to have me give an exhibition and kill

somebody, that the thing grew to be embarrassing.  However, to my

relief she was presently interrupted by the call to prayers.  I will

say this much for the nobility: that, tyrannical, murderous,

rapacious, and morally rotten as they were, they were deeply and

enthusiastically religious.  Nothing could divert them from the

regular and faithful performance of the pieties enjoined by the

Church.  More than once I had seen a noble who had gotten his

enemy at a disadvantage, stop to pray before cutting his throat;

more than once I had seen a noble, after ambushing and despatching

his enemy, retire to the nearest wayside shrine and humbly give

thanks, without even waiting to rob the body.  There was to be

nothing finer or sweeter in the life of even Benvenuto Cellini,

that rough-hewn saint, ten centuries later.  All the nobles of

Britain, with their families, attended divine service morning and

night daily, in their private chapels, and even the worst of them

had family worship five or six times a day besides.  The credit

of this belonged entirely to the Church.  Although I was no friend

to that Catholic Church, I was obliged to admit this.  And often,

in spite of me, I found myself saying, "What would this country

be without the Church?"



After prayers we had dinner in a great banqueting hall which was

lighted by hundreds of grease-jets, and everything was as fine and

lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the

hosts.  At the head of the hall, on a dais, was the table of the

king, queen, and their son, Prince Uwaine.  Stretching down the hall

from this, was the general table, on the floor.  At this, above

the salt, sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their

families, of both sexes,--the resident Court, in effect--sixty-one

persons; below the salt sat minor officers of the household, with

their principal subordinates: altogether a hundred and eighteen

persons sitting, and about as many liveried servants standing

behind their chairs, or serving in one capacity or another.  It was

a very fine show.  In a gallery a band with cymbals, horns, harps,

and other horrors, opened the proceedings with what seemed to be

the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later

centuries as "In the Sweet Bye and Bye."  It was new, and ought

to have been rehearsed a little more.  For some reason or other

the queen had the composer hanged, after dinner.



After this music, the priest who stood behind the royal table said

a noble long grace in ostensible Latin.  Then the battalion of

waiters broke away from their posts, and darted, rushed, flew,

fetched and carried, and the mighty feeding began; no words

anywhere, but absorbing attention to business.  The rows of chops

opened and shut in vast unison, and the sound of it was like to

the muffled burr of subterranean machinery.



The havoc continued an hour and a half, and unimaginable was the

destruction of substantials.  Of the chief feature of the feast

--the huge wild boar that lay stretched out so portly and imposing

at the start--nothing was left but the semblance of a hoop-skirt;

and he was but the type and symbol of what had happened to all

the other dishes.



With the pastries and so on, the heavy drinking began--and the talk.

Gallon after gallon of wine and mead disappeared, and everybody

got comfortable, then happy, then sparklingly joyous--both sexes,

--and by and by pretty noisy.  Men told anecdotes that were terrific

to hear, but nobody blushed; and when the nub was sprung, the

assemblage let go with a horse-laugh that shook the fortress.

Ladies answered back with historiettes that would almost have made

Queen Margaret of Navarre or even the great Elizabeth of England

hide behind a handkerchief, but nobody hid here, but only laughed

--howled, you may say.  In pretty much all of these dreadful stories,

ecclesiastics were the hardy heroes, but that didn't worry the

chaplain any, he had his laugh with the rest; more than that, upon

invitation he roared out a song which was of as daring a sort as

any that was sung that night.



By midnight everybody was fagged out, and sore with laughing; and,

as a rule, drunk: some weepingly, some affectionately, some

hilariously, some quarrelsomely, some dead and under the table.

Of the ladies, the worst spectacle was a lovely young duchess, whose

wedding-eve this was; and indeed she was a spectacle, sure enough.

Just as she was she could have sat in advance for the portrait of the

young daughter of the Regent d'Orleans, at the famous dinner whence

she was carried, foul-mouthed, intoxicated, and helpless, to her bed,

in the lost and lamented days of the Ancient Regime.



Suddenly, even while the priest was lifting his hands, and all

conscious heads were bowed in reverent expectation of the coming

blessing, there appeared under the arch of the far-off door at

the bottom of the hall an old and bent and white-haired lady,

leaning upon a crutch-stick; and she lifted the stick and pointed it

toward the queen and cried out:



"The wrath and curse of God fall upon you, woman without pity,

who have slain mine innocent grandchild and made desolate this

old heart that had nor chick, nor friend nor stay nor comfort in

all this world but him!"



Everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright, for a curse was an

awful thing to those people; but the queen rose up majestic, with

the death-light in her eye, and flung back this ruthless command:



"Lay hands on her!  To the stake with her!"



The guards left their posts to obey.  It was a shame; it was a

cruel thing to see.  What could be done?  Sandy gave me a look;

I knew she had another inspiration.  I said:



"Do what you choose."



She was up and facing toward the queen in a moment.  She indicated

me, and said:



"Madame, _he_ saith this may not be.  Recall the commandment, or he

will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable

fabric of a dream!"



Confound it, what a crazy contract to pledge a person to!  What if

the queen--



But my consternation subsided there, and my panic passed off;

for the queen, all in a collapse, made no show of resistance but

gave a countermanding sign and sunk into her seat.  When she reached

it she was sober.  So were many of the others.  The assemblage rose,

whiffed ceremony to the winds, and rushed for the door like a mob;

overturning chairs, smashing crockery, tugging, struggling,

shouldering, crowding--anything to get out before I should change

my mind and puff the castle into the measureless dim vacancies of

space.  Well, well, well, they _were_ a superstitious lot.  It is

all a body can do to conceive of it.



The poor queen was so scared and humbled that she was even afraid

to hang the composer without first consulting me.  I was very sorry

for her--indeed, any one would have been, for she was really

suffering; so I was willing to do anything that was reasonable, and

had no desire to carry things to wanton extremities.  I therefore

considered the matter thoughtfully, and ended by having the

musicians ordered into our presence to play that Sweet Bye and

Bye again, which they did.  Then I saw that she was right, and

gave her permission to hang the whole band.  This little relaxation

of sternness had a good effect upon the queen.  A statesman gains

little by the arbitrary exercise of iron-clad authority upon all

occasions that offer, for this wounds the just pride of his

subordinates, and thus tends to undermine his strength.  A little

concession, now and then, where it can do no harm, is the wiser policy.



Now that the queen was at ease in her mind once more, and measurably

happy, her wine naturally began to assert itself again, and it got

a little the start of her.  I mean it set her music going--her silver

bell of a tongue.  Dear me, she was a master talker.  It would not

become me to suggest that it was pretty late and that I was a tired

man and very sleepy.  I wished I had gone off to bed when I had

the chance.  Now I must stick it out; there was no other way.  So

she tinkled along and along, in the otherwise profound and ghostly

hush of the sleeping castle, until by and by there came, as if

from deep down under us, a far-away sound, as of a muffled shriek

--with an expression of agony about it that made my flesh crawl.

The queen stopped, and her eyes lighted with pleasure; she tilted

her graceful head as a bird does when it listens.  The sound bored

its way up through the stillness again.



"What is it?" I said.



"It is truly a stubborn soul, and endureth long.  It is many hours now."



"Endureth what?"



"The rack.  Come--ye shall see a blithe sight.  An he yield not

his secret now, ye shall see him torn asunder."



What a silky smooth hellion she was; and so composed and serene,

when the cords all down my legs were hurting in sympathy with that

man's pain.  Conducted by mailed guards bearing flaring torches,

we tramped along echoing corridors, and down stone stairways dank

and dripping, and smelling of mould and ages of imprisoned night

--a chill, uncanny journey and a long one, and not made the shorter

or the cheerier by the sorceress's talk, which was about this

sufferer and his crime.  He had been accused by an anonymous

informer, of having killed a stag in the royal preserves.  I said:



"Anonymous testimony isn't just the right thing, your Highness.

It were fairer to confront the accused with the accuser."



"I had not thought of that, it being but of small consequence.

But an I would, I could not, for that the accuser came masked by

night, and told the forester, and straightway got him hence again,

and so the forester knoweth him not."



"Then is this Unknown the only person who saw the stag killed?"



"Marry, _no_ man _saw_ the killing, but this Unknown saw this hardy

wretch near to the spot where the stag lay, and came with right

loyal zeal and betrayed him to the forester."



"So the Unknown was near the dead stag, too?  Isn't it just possible

that he did the killing himself?  His loyal zeal--in a mask--looks

just a shade suspicious.  But what is your highness's idea for

racking the prisoner?  Where is the profit?"



"He will not confess, else; and then were his soul lost.  For his

crime his life is forfeited by the law--and of a surety will I see

that he payeth it!--but it were peril to my own soul to let him

die unconfessed and unabsolved.  Nay, I were a fool to fling me

into hell for _his_ accommodation."



"But, your Highness, suppose he has nothing to confess?"



"As to that, we shall see, anon.  An I rack him to death and he

confess not, it will peradventure show that he had indeed naught

to confess--ye will grant that that is sooth?  Then shall I not be

damned for an unconfessed man that had naught to confess

--wherefore, I shall be safe."



It was the stubborn unreasoning of the time.  It was useless to

argue with her.  Arguments have no chance against petrified

training; they wear it as little as the waves wear a cliff.  And

her training was everybody's.  The brightest intellect in the land

would not have been able to see that her position was defective.



As we entered the rack-cell I caught a picture that will not go

from me; I wish it would.  A native young giant of thirty or

thereabouts lay stretched upon the frame on his back, with his

wrists and ankles tied to ropes which led over windlasses at either

end.  There was no color in him; his features were contorted and

set, and sweat-drops stood upon his forehead.  A priest bent over

him on each side; the executioner stood by; guards were on duty;

smoking torches stood in sockets along the walls; in a corner

crouched a poor young creature, her face drawn with anguish,

a half-wild and hunted look in her eyes, and in her lap lay a little

child asleep.  Just as we stepped across the threshold the

executioner gave his machine a slight turn, which wrung a cry

from both the prisoner and the woman; but I shouted, and the

executioner released the strain without waiting to see who spoke.

I could not let this horror go on; it would have killed me to

see it.  I asked the queen to let me clear the place and speak

to the prisoner privately; and when she was going to object I spoke

in a low voice and said I did not want to make a scene before

her servants, but I must have my way; for I was King Arthur's

representative, and was speaking in his name.  She saw she had

to yield.  I asked her to indorse me to these people, and then

leave me.  It was not pleasant for her, but she took the pill;

and even went further than I was meaning to require.  I only wanted

the backing of her own authority; but she said:



"Ye will do in all things as this lord shall command.  It is The Boss."



It was certainly a good word to conjure with: you could see it

by the squirming of these rats.  The queen's guards fell into line,

and she and they marched away, with their torch-bearers, and woke

the echoes of the cavernous tunnels with the measured beat of their

retreating footfalls.  I had the prisoner taken from the rack and

placed upon his bed, and medicaments applied to his hurts, and

wine given him to drink.  The woman crept near and looked on,

eagerly, lovingly, but timorously,--like one who fears a repulse;

indeed, she tried furtively to touch the man's forehead, and jumped

back, the picture of fright, when I turned unconsciously toward

her.  It was pitiful to see.



"Lord," I said, "stroke him, lass, if you want to.  Do anything

you're a mind to; don't mind me."



Why, her eyes were as grateful as an animal's, when you do it

a kindness that it understands.  The baby was out of her way and

she had her cheek against the man's in a minute and her hands

fondling his hair, and her happy tears running down.  The man

revived and caressed his wife with his eyes, which was all he

could do.  I judged I might clear the den, now, and I did; cleared

it of all but the family and myself.  Then I said:



"Now, my friend, tell me your side of this matter; I know

the other side."



The man moved his head in sign of refusal.  But the woman looked

pleased--as it seemed to me--pleased with my suggestion.  I went on--



"You know of me?"



"Yes.  All do, in Arthur's realms."



"If my reputation has come to you right and straight, you should

not be afraid to speak."



The woman broke in, eagerly:



"Ah, fair my lord, do thou persuade him!  Thou canst an thou wilt.

Ah, he suffereth so; and it is for me--for _me_!  And how can I bear it?

I would I might see him die--a sweet, swift death; oh, my Hugo,

I cannot bear this one!"



And she fell to sobbing and grovelling about my feet, and still

imploring.  Imploring what?  The man's death?  I could not quite

get the bearings of the thing.  But Hugo interrupted her and said:



"Peace!  Ye wit not what ye ask.  Shall I starve whom I love,

to win a gentle death?  I wend thou knewest me better."



"Well," I said, "I can't quite make this out.  It is a puzzle.  Now--"



"Ah, dear my lord, an ye will but persuade him!  Consider how

these his tortures wound me!  Oh, and he will not speak!--whereas,

the healing, the solace that lie in a blessed swift death--"



"What _are_ you maundering about?  He's going out from here a free

man and whole--he's not going to die."



The man's white face lit up, and the woman flung herself at me

in a most surprising explosion of joy, and cried out:



"He is saved!--for it is the king's word by the mouth of the king's

servant--Arthur, the king whose word is gold!"



"Well, then you do believe I can be trusted, after all.  Why

didn't you before?"



"Who doubted?  Not I, indeed; and not she."



"Well, why wouldn't you tell me your story, then?"



"Ye had made no promise; else had it been otherwise."



"I see, I see....  And yet I believe I don't quite see, after all.

You stood the torture and refused to confess; which shows plain

enough to even the dullest understanding that you had nothing

to confess--"



"I, my lord?  How so?  It was I that killed the deer!"



"You _did_?  Oh, dear, this is the most mixed-up business that ever--"



"Dear lord, I begged him on my knees to confess, but--"



"You _did_!  It gets thicker and thicker.  What did you want him

to do that for?"



"Sith it would bring him a quick death and save him all this

cruel pain."



"Well--yes, there is reason in that.  But _he_ didn't want the

quick death."



"He?  Why, of a surety he _did_."



"Well, then, why in the world _didn't_ he confess?"



"Ah, sweet sir, and leave my wife and chick without bread and shelter?"



"Oh, heart of gold, now I see it!  The bitter law takes the convicted

man's estate and beggars his widow and his orphans.  They could

torture you to death, but without conviction or confession they

could not rob your wife and baby.  You stood by them like a man;

and _you_--true wife and the woman that you are--you would have

bought him release from torture at cost to yourself of slow

starvation and death--well, it humbles a body to think what your

sex can do when it comes to self-sacrifice.  I'll book you both

for my colony; you'll like it there; it's a Factory where I'm going

to turn groping and grubbing automata into _men_."







CHAPTER XVIII



IN THE QUEEN'S DUNGEONS



Well, I arranged all that; and I had the man sent to his home.

I had a great desire to rack the executioner; not because he was

a good, painstaking and paingiving official,--for surely it was

not to his discredit that he performed his functions well--but to

pay him back for wantonly cuffing and otherwise distressing that

young woman.  The priests told me about this, and were generously

hot to have him punished.  Something of this disagreeable sort

was turning up every now and then.  I mean, episodes that showed

that not all priests were frauds and self-seekers, but that many,

even the great majority, of these that were down on the ground

among the common people, were sincere and right-hearted, and

devoted to the alleviation of human troubles and sufferings.

Well, it was a thing which could not be helped, so I seldom fretted

about it, and never many minutes at a time; it has never been my

way to bother much about things which you can't cure.  But I did

not like it, for it was just the sort of thing to keep people

reconciled to an Established Church.  We _must_ have a religion

--it goes without saying--but my idea is, to have it cut up into

forty free sects, so that they will police each other, as had been

the case in the United States in my time.  Concentration of power

in a political machine is bad; and and an Established Church is

only a political machine; it was invented for that; it is nursed,

cradled, preserved for that; it is an enemy to human liberty, and

does no good which it could not better do in a split-up and scattered

condition.  That wasn't law; it wasn't gospel: it was only

an opinion--my opinion, and I was only a man, one man: so it wasn't

worth any more than the pope's--or any less, for that matter.



Well, I couldn't rack the executioner, neither would I overlook

the just complaint of the priests.  The man must be punished

somehow or other, so I degraded him from his office and made him

leader of the band--the new one that was to be started.  He begged

hard, and said he couldn't play--a plausible excuse, but too thin;

there wasn't a musician in the country that could.



The queen was a good deal outraged, next morning when she found

she was going to have neither Hugo's life nor his property.  But

I told her she must bear this cross; that while by law and custom

she certainly was entitled to both the man's life and his property,

there were extenuating circumstances, and so in Arthur the king's

name I had pardoned him.  The deer was ravaging the man's fields,

and he had killed it in sudden passion, and not for gain; and he

had carried it into the royal forest in the hope that that might make

detection of the misdoer impossible.  Confound her, I couldn't

make her see that sudden passion is an extenuating circumstance

in the killing of venison--or of a person--so I gave it up and let

her sulk it out.  I _did_ think I was going to make her see it by

remarking that her own sudden passion in the case of the page

modified that crime.



"Crime!" she exclaimed.  "How thou talkest!  Crime, forsooth!

Man, I am going to _pay_ for him!"



Oh, it was no use to waste sense on her.  Training--training is

everything; training is all there is _to_ a person.  We speak of

nature; it is folly; there is no such thing as nature; what we

call by that misleading name is merely heredity and training.

We have no thoughts of our own, no opinions of our own; they are

transmitted to us, trained into us.  All that is original in us,

and therefore fairly creditable or discreditable to us, can be

covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the

rest being atoms contributed by, and inherited from, a procession

of ancestors that stretches back a billion years to the Adam-clam

or grasshopper or monkey from whom our race has been so tediously

and ostentatiously and unprofitably developed.  And as for me,

all that I think about in this plodding sad pilgrimage, this

pathetic drift between the eternities, is to look out and humbly

live a pure and high and blameless life, and save that one

microscopic atom in me that is truly _me_: the rest may land in

Sheol and welcome for all I care.



No, confound her, her intellect was good, she had brains enough,

but her training made her an ass--that is, from a many-centuries-later

point of view.  To kill the page was no crime--it was her right;

and upon her right she stood, serenely and unconscious of offense.

She was a result of generations of training in the unexamined and

unassailed belief that the law which permitted her to kill a subject

when she chose was a perfectly right and righteous one.



Well, we must give even Satan his due.  She deserved a compliment

for one thing; and I tried to pay it, but the words stuck in my

throat.  She had a right to kill the boy, but she was in no wise

obliged to pay for him.  That was law for some other people, but

not for her.  She knew quite well that she was doing a large and

generous thing to pay for that lad, and that I ought in common

fairness to come out with something handsome about it, but I

couldn't--my mouth refused.  I couldn't help seeing, in my fancy,

that poor old grandma with the broken heart, and that fair young

creature lying butchered, his little silken pomps and vanities

laced with his golden blood.  How could she _pay_ for him!  _Whom_

could she pay?  And so, well knowing that this woman, trained

as she had been, deserved praise, even adulation, I was yet not

able to utter it, trained as I had been.  The best I could do was

to fish up a compliment from outside, so to speak--and the pity

of it was, that it was true:



"Madame, your people will adore you for this."



Quite true, but I meant to hang her for it some day if I lived.

Some of those laws were too bad, altogether too bad.  A master

might kill his slave for nothing--for mere spite, malice, or

to pass the time--just as we have seen that the crowned head could

do it with _his_ slave, that is to say, anybody.  A gentleman could

kill a free commoner, and pay for him--cash or garden-truck.

A noble could kill a noble without expense, as far as the law was

concerned, but reprisals in kind were to be expected.  _Any_body

could kill _some_body, except the commoner and the slave; these had

no privileges.  If they killed, it was murder, and the law wouldn't

stand murder.  It made short work of the experimenter--and of

his family, too, if he murdered somebody who belonged up among

the ornamental ranks.  If a commoner gave a noble even so much

as a Damiens-scratch which didn't kill or even hurt, he got Damiens'

dose for it just the same; they pulled him to rags and tatters

with horses, and all the world came to see the show, and crack

jokes, and have a good time; and some of the performances of the

best people present were as tough, and as properly unprintable,

as any that have been printed by the pleasant Casanova in his

chapter about the dismemberment of Louis XV's poor awkward enemy.



I had had enough of this grisly place by this time, and wanted

to leave, but I couldn't, because I had something on my mind that

my conscience kept prodding me about, and wouldn't let me forget.

If I had the remaking of man, he wouldn't have any conscience.

It is one of the most disagreeable things connected with a person;

and although it certainly does a great deal of good, it cannot

be said to pay, in the long run; it would be much better to have

less good and more comfort.  Still, this is only my opinion, and

I am only one man; others, with less experience, may think

differently.  They have a right to their view.  I only stand

to this: I have noticed my conscience for many years, and I know

it is more trouble and bother to me than anything else I started

with.  I suppose that in the beginning I prized it, because we

prize anything that is ours; and yet how foolish it was to think so.

If we look at it in another way, we see how absurd it is: if I had

an anvil in me would I prize it?  Of course not.  And yet when you

come to think, there is no real difference between a conscience

and an anvil--I mean for comfort.  I have noticed it a thousand

times.  And you could dissolve an anvil with acids, when you

couldn't stand it any longer; but there isn't any way that you can

work off a conscience--at least so it will stay worked off; not

that I know of, anyway.



There was something I wanted to do before leaving, but it was

a disagreeable matter, and I hated to go at it.  Well, it bothered

me all the morning.  I could have mentioned it to the old king,

but what would be the use?--he was but an extinct volcano; he had

been active in his time, but his fire was out, this good while,

he was only a stately ash-pile now; gentle enough, and kindly

enough for my purpose, without doubt, but not usable.  He was

nothing, this so-called king: the queen was the only power there.

And she was a Vesuvius.  As a favor, she might consent to warm

a flock of sparrows for you, but then she might take that very

opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city.  However,

I reflected that as often as any other way, when you are expecting

the worst, you get something that is not so bad, after all.



So I braced up and placed my matter before her royal Highness.

I said I had been having a general jail-delivery at Camelot and

among neighboring castles, and with her permission I would like

to examine her collection, her bric-a-brac--that is to say, her

prisoners.  She resisted; but I was expecting that.  But she finally

consented.  I was expecting that, too, but not so soon.  That about

ended my discomfort.  She called her guards and torches, and

we went down into the dungeons.  These were down under the castle's

foundations, and mainly were small cells hollowed out of the living

rock.  Some of these cells had no light at all.  In one of them was

a woman, in foul rags, who sat on the ground, and would not answer

a question or speak a word, but only looked up at us once or twice,

through a cobweb of tangled hair, as if to see what casual thing

it might be that was disturbing with sound and light the meaningless

dull dream that was become her life; after that, she sat bowed,

with her dirt-caked fingers idly interlocked in her lap, and gave

no further sign.  This poor rack of bones was a woman of middle

age, apparently; but only apparently; she had been there nine

years, and was eighteen when she entered.  She was a commoner,

and had been sent here on her bridal night by Sir Breuse Sance Pite,

a neighboring lord whose vassal her father was, and to which said

lord she had refused what has since been called le droit du

seigneur, and, moreover, had opposed violence to violence and spilt

half a gill of his almost sacred blood.  The young husband had

interfered at that point, believing the bride's life in danger,

and had flung the noble out into the midst of the humble and

trembling wedding guests, in the parlor, and left him there

astonished at this strange treatment, and implacably embittered

against both bride and groom.  The said lord being cramped for

dungeon-room had asked the queen to accommodate his two criminals,

and here in her bastile they had been ever since; hither, indeed,

they had come before their crime was an hour old, and had never

seen each other since.  Here they were, kenneled like toads in the

same rock; they had passed nine pitch dark years within fifty feet

of each other, yet neither knew whether the other was alive or not.

All the first years, their only question had been--asked with

beseechings and tears that might have moved stones, in time,

perhaps, but hearts are not stones: "Is he alive?"  "Is she alive?"

But they had never got an answer; and at last that question was

not asked any more--or any other.



I wanted to see the man, after hearing all this.  He was thirty-four

years old, and looked sixty.  He sat upon a squared block of

stone, with his head bent down, his forearms resting on his knees,

his long hair hanging like a fringe before his face, and he was

muttering to himself.  He raised his chin and looked us slowly

over, in a listless dull way, blinking with the distress of the

torchlight, then dropped his head and fell to muttering again

and took no further notice of us.  There were some pathetically

suggestive dumb witnesses present.  On his wrists and ankles were

cicatrices, old smooth scars, and fastened to the stone on which

he sat was a chain with manacles and fetters attached; but this

apparatus lay idle on the ground, and was thick with rust.  Chains

cease to be needed after the spirit has gone out of a prisoner.



I could not rouse the man; so I said we would take him to her,

and see--to the bride who was the fairest thing in the earth to him,

once--roses, pearls, and dew made flesh, for him; a wonder-work,

the master-work of nature: with eyes like no other eyes, and voice

like no other voice, and a freshness, and lithe young grace, and

beauty, that belonged properly to the creatures of dreams--as he

thought--and to no other.  The sight of her would set his stagnant

blood leaping; the sight of her--



But it was a disappointment.  They sat together on the ground and

looked dimly wondering into each other's faces a while, with a

sort of weak animal curiosity; then forgot each other's presence,

and dropped their eyes, and you saw that they were away again and

wandering in some far land of dreams and shadows that we know

nothing about.



I had them taken out and sent to their friends.  The queen did not

like it much.  Not that she felt any personal interest in the matter,

but she thought it disrespectful to Sir Breuse Sance Pite.  However,

I assured her that if he found he couldn't stand it I would fix him

so that he could.



I set forty-seven prisoners loose out of those awful rat-holes,

and left only one in captivity.  He was a lord, and had killed

another lord, a sort of kinsman of the queen.  That other lord

had ambushed him to assassinate him, but this fellow had got the

best of him and cut his throat.  However, it was not for that that

I left him jailed, but for maliciously destroying the only public

well in one of his wretched villages.  The queen was bound to hang

him for killing her kinsman, but I would not allow it: it was no

crime to kill an assassin.  But I said I was willing to let her

hang him for destroying the well; so she concluded to put up with

that, as it was better than nothing.



Dear me, for what trifling offenses the most of those forty-seven

men and women were shut up there!  Indeed, some were there for

no distinct offense at all, but only to gratify somebody's spite;

and not always the queen's by any means, but a friend's.  The newest

prisoner's crime was a mere remark which he had made.  He said

he believed that men were about all alike, and one man as good

as another, barring clothes.  He said he believed that if you were

to strip the nation naked and send a stranger through the crowd, he

couldn't tell the king from a quack doctor, nor a duke from a hotel

clerk.  Apparently here was a man whose brains had not been reduced

to an ineffectual mush by idiotic training.  I set him loose and

sent him to the Factory.



Some of the cells carved in the living rock were just behind the

face of the precipice, and in each of these an arrow-slit had been

pierced outward to the daylight, and so the captive had a thin

ray from the blessed sun for his comfort.  The case of one of

these poor fellows was particularly hard.  From his dusky swallow's

hole high up in that vast wall of native rock he could peer out

through the arrow-slit and see his own home off yonder in the

valley; and for twenty-two years he had watched it, with heartache

and longing, through that crack.  He could see the lights shine

there at night, and in the daytime he could see figures go in and

come out--his wife and children, some of them, no doubt, though

he could not make out at that distance.  In the course of years

he noted festivities there, and tried to rejoice, and wondered

if they were weddings or what they might be.  And he noted funerals;

and they wrung his heart.  He could make out the coffin, but he

could not determine its size, and so could not tell whether it was

wife or child.  He could see the procession form, with priests

and mourners, and move solemnly away, bearing the secret with

them.  He had left behind him five children and a wife; and in

nineteen years he had seen five funerals issue, and none of them

humble enough in pomp to denote a servant.  So he had lost five

of his treasures; there must still be one remaining--one now

infinitely, unspeakably precious,--but _which_ one? wife, or child?

That was the question that tortured him, by night and by day,

asleep and awake.  Well, to have an interest, of some sort, and

half a ray of light, when you are in a dungeon, is a great support

to the body and preserver of the intellect.  This man was in pretty

good condition yet.  By the time he had finished telling me his

distressful tale, I was in the same state of mind that you would

have been in yourself, if you have got average human curiosity;

that is to say, I was as burning up as he was to find out which

member of the family it was that was left.  So I took him over

home myself; and an amazing kind of a surprise party it was, too

--typhoons and cyclones of frantic joy, and whole Niagaras of happy

tears; and by George! we found the aforetime young matron graying

toward the imminent verge of her half century, and the babies all

men and women, and some of them married and experimenting familywise

themselves--for not a soul of the tribe was dead!  Conceive of the

ingenious devilishness of that queen: she had a special hatred for

this prisoner, and she had _invented_ all those funerals herself,

to scorch his heart with; and the sublimest stroke of genius of

the whole thing was leaving the family-invoice a funeral _short_,

so as to let him wear his poor old soul out guessing.



But for me, he never would have got out.  Morgan le Fay hated him

with her whole heart, and she never would have softened toward him.

And yet his crime was committed more in thoughtlessness than

deliberate depravity.  He had said she had red hair.  Well, she

had; but that was no way to speak of it.  When red-headed people

are above a certain social grade their hair is auburn.



Consider it: among these forty-seven captives there were five

whose names, offenses, and dates of incarceration were no longer

known!  One woman and four men--all bent, and wrinkled, and

mind-extinguished patriarchs.  They themselves had long ago forgotten

these details; at any rate they had mere vague theories about them,

nothing definite and nothing that they repeated twice in the same

way.  The succession of priests whose office it had been to pray

daily with the captives and remind them that God had put them

there, for some wise purpose or other, and teach them that patience,

humbleness, and submission to oppression was what He loved to see

in parties of a subordinate rank, had traditions about these poor

old human ruins, but nothing more.  These traditions went but

little way, for they concerned the length of the incarceration only,

and not the names of the offenses.  And even by the help of

tradition the only thing that could be proven was that none of

the five had seen daylight for thirty-five years: how much longer

this privation has lasted was not guessable.  The king and the queen

knew nothing about these poor creatures, except that they were

heirlooms, assets inherited, along with the throne, from the former

firm.  Nothing of their history had been transmitted with their

persons, and so the inheriting owners had considered them of no

value, and had felt no interest in them.  I said to the queen:



"Then why in the world didn't you set them free?"



The question was a puzzler.  She didn't know _why_ she hadn't, the

thing had never come up in her mind.  So here she was, forecasting

the veritable history of future prisoners of the Castle d'If,

without knowing it.  It seemed plain to me now, that with her

training, those inherited prisoners were merely property--nothing

more, nothing less.  Well, when we inherit property, it does not

occur to us to throw it away, even when we do not value it.



When I brought my procession of human bats up into the open world

and the glare of the afternoon sun--previously blindfolding them,

in charity for eyes so long untortured by light--they were a

spectacle to look at.  Skeletons, scarecrows, goblins, pathetic

frights, every one; legitimatest possible children of Monarchy

by the Grace of God and the Established Church.  I muttered absently:



"I _wish_ I could photograph them!"



You have seen that kind of people who will never let on that they

don't know the meaning of a new big word.  The more ignorant they

are, the more pitifully certain they are to pretend you haven't

shot over their heads.  The queen was just one of that sort, and

was always making the stupidest blunders by reason of it.  She

hesitated a moment; then her face brightened up with sudden

comprehension, and she said she would do it for me.



I thought to myself: She? why what can she know about photography?

But it was a poor time to be thinking.  When I looked around, she

was moving on the procession with an axe!



Well, she certainly was a curious one, was Morgan le Fay.  I have

seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them

all for variety.  And how sharply characteristic of her this episode

was.  She had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph

a procession; but being in doubt, it was just like her to try

to do it with an axe.







CHAPTER XIX



KNIGHT-ERRANTRY AS A TRADE



Sandy and I were on the road again, next morning, bright and early.

It was so good to open up one's lungs and take in whole luscious

barrels-ful of the blessed God's untainted, dew-fashioned,

woodland-scented air once more, after suffocating body and mind for two

days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable

old buzzard-roost!  I mean, for me: of course the place was all

right and agreeable enough for Sandy, for she had been used to

high life all her days.



Poor girl, her jaws had had a wearisome rest now for a while,

and I was expecting to get the consequences.  I was right; but she

had stood by me most helpfully in the castle, and had mightily

supported and reinforced me with gigantic foolishnesses which were

worth more for the occasion than wisdoms double their size; so

I thought she had earned a right to work her mill for a while,

if she wanted to, and I felt not a pang when she started it up:



"Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty

winter of age southward--"



"Are you going to see if you can work up another half-stretch on

the trail of the cowboys, Sandy?"



"Even so, fair my lord."



"Go ahead, then.  I won't interrupt this time, if I can help it.

Begin over again; start fair, and shake out all your reefs, and

I will load my pipe and give good attention."



"Now turn we unto Sir Marhaus that rode with the damsel of thirty

winter of age southward.  And so they came into a deep forest,

and by fortune they were nighted, and rode along in a deep way,

and at the last they came into a courtelage where abode the duke

of South Marches, and there they asked harbour.  And on the morn

the duke sent unto Sir Marhaus, and bad him make him ready.  And

so Sir Marhaus arose and armed him, and there was a mass sung

afore him, and he brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in

the court of the castle, there they should do the battle.  So there

was the duke already on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons

by him, and every each had a spear in his hand, and so they

encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears

upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of

them.  Then came the four sons by couples, and two of them brake

their spears, and so did the other two.  And all this while

Sir Marhaus touched them not.  Then Sir Marhaus ran to the duke,

and smote him with his spear that horse and man fell to the earth.

And so he served his sons.  And then Sir Marhaus alight down, and

bad the duke yield him or else he would slay him.  And then some

of his sons recovered, and would have set upon Sir Marhaus.  Then

Sir Marhaus said to the duke, Cease thy sons, or else I will do

the uttermost to you all.  When the duke saw he might not escape

the death, he cried to his sons, and charged them to yield them

to Sir Marhaus.  And they kneeled all down and put the pommels

of their swords to the knight, and so he received them.  And then

they holp up their father, and so by their common assent promised

unto Sir Marhaus never to be foes unto King Arthur, and thereupon

at Whitsuntide after, to come he and his sons, and put them in

the king's grace.*



[*Footnote: The story is borrowed, language and all, from the

Morte d'Arthur.--M.T.]



"Even so standeth the history, fair Sir Boss.  Now ye shall wit

that that very duke and his six sons are they whom but few days

past you also did overcome and send to Arthur's court!"



"Why, Sandy, you can't mean it!"



"An I speak not sooth, let it be the worse for me."



"Well, well, well,--now who would ever have thought it?  One

whole duke and six dukelets; why, Sandy, it was an elegant haul.

Knight-errantry is a most chuckle-headed trade, and it is tedious

hard work, too, but I begin to see that there _is_ money in it,

after all, if you have luck.  Not that I would ever engage in it

as a business, for I wouldn't.  No sound and legitimate business

can be established on a basis of speculation.  A successful whirl

in the knight-errantry line--now what is it when you blow away

the nonsense and come down to the cold facts?  It's just a corner

in pork, that's all, and you can't make anything else out of it.

You're rich--yes,--suddenly rich--for about a day, maybe a week;

then somebody corners the market on _you_, and down goes your

bucket-shop; ain't that so, Sandy?"



"Whethersoever it be that my mind miscarrieth, bewraying simple

language in such sort that the words do seem to come endlong

and overthwart--"



"There's no use in beating about the bush and trying to get around

it that way, Sandy, it's _so_, just as I say.  I _know_ it's so.  And,

moreover, when you come right down to the bedrock, knight-errantry

is _worse_ than pork; for whatever happens, the pork's left, and

so somebody's benefited anyway; but when the market breaks, in a

knight-errantry whirl, and every knight in the pool passes in his

checks, what have you got for assets?  Just a rubbish-pile of

battered corpses and a barrel or two of busted hardware.  Can you

call _those_ assets?  Give me pork, every time.  Am I right?"



"Ah, peradventure my head being distraught by the manifold matters

whereunto the confusions of these but late adventured haps and

fortunings whereby not I alone nor you alone, but every each of us,

meseemeth--"



"No, it's not your head, Sandy.  Your head's all right, as far as

it goes, but you don't know business; that's where the trouble

is.  It unfits you to argue about business, and you're wrong

to be always trying.  However, that aside, it was a good haul,

anyway, and will breed a handsome crop of reputation in Arthur's

court.  And speaking of the cowboys, what a curious country this

is for women and men that never get old.  Now there's Morgan le Fay,

as fresh and young as a Vassar pullet, to all appearances, and

here is this old duke of the South Marches still slashing away with

sword and lance at his time of life, after raising such a family

as he has raised.  As I understand it, Sir Gawaine killed seven

of his sons, and still he had six left for Sir Marhaus and me to

take into camp.  And then there was that damsel of sixty winter

of age still excursioning around in her frosty bloom--How old

are you, Sandy?"



It was the first time I ever struck a still place in her.  The mill

had shut down for repairs, or something.







CHAPTER XX



THE OGRE'S CASTLE



Between six and nine we made ten miles, which was plenty for a

horse carrying triple--man, woman, and armor; then we stopped

for a long nooning under some trees by a limpid brook.



Right so came by and by a knight riding; and as he drew near he

made dolorous moan, and by the words of it I perceived that he

was cursing and swearing; yet nevertheless was I glad of his

coming, for that I saw he bore a bulletin-board whereon in letters

all of shining gold was writ:



    "USE PETERSON'S PROPHYLACTIC TOOTH-BRUSH--ALL THE GO."



I was glad of his coming, for even by this token I knew him for

knight of mine.  It was Sir Madok de la Montaine, a burly great

fellow whose chief distinction was that he had come within an ace

of sending Sir Launcelot down over his horse-tail once.  He was

never long in a stranger's presence without finding some pretext

or other to let out that great fact.  But there was another fact

of nearly the same size, which he never pushed upon anybody unasked,

and yet never withheld when asked: that was, that the reason he

didn't quite succeed was, that he was interrupted and sent down

over horse-tail himself.  This innocent vast lubber did not see

any particular difference between the two facts.  I liked him,

for he was earnest in his work, and very valuable.  And he was so

fine to look at, with his broad mailed shoulders, and the grand

leonine set of his plumed head, and his big shield with its quaint

device of a gauntleted hand clutching a prophylactic tooth-brush,

with motto: "Try Noyoudont."  This was a tooth-wash that I was

introducing.



He was aweary, he said, and indeed he looked it; but he would not

alight.  He said he was after the stove-polish man; and with this

he broke out cursing and swearing anew.  The bulletin-boarder

referred to was Sir Ossaise of Surluse, a brave knight, and of

considerable celebrity on account of his having tried conclusions

in a tournament once, with no less a Mogul than Sir Gaheris

himself--although not successfully.  He was of a light and laughing

disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious.  It was

for this reason that I had chosen him to work up a stove-polish

sentiment.  There were no stoves yet, and so there could be nothing

serious about stove-polish.  All that the agent needed to do was

to deftly and by degrees prepare the public for the great change,

and have them established in predilections toward neatness against

the time when the stove should appear upon the stage.



Sir Madok was very bitter, and brake out anew with cursings.  He

said he had cursed his soul to rags; and yet he would not get down

from his horse, neither would he take any rest, or listen to any

comfort, until he should have found Sir Ossaise and settled this

account.  It appeared, by what I could piece together of the

unprofane fragments of his statement, that he had chanced upon

Sir Ossaise at dawn of the morning, and been told that if he would

make a short cut across the fields and swamps and broken hills and

glades, he could head off a company of travelers who would be rare

customers for prophylactics and tooth-wash.  With characteristic

zeal Sir Madok had plunged away at once upon this quest, and after

three hours of awful crosslot riding had overhauled his game.  And

behold, it was the five patriarchs that had been released from the

dungeons the evening before!  Poor old creatures, it was all of

twenty years since any one of them had known what it was to be

equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.



"Blank-blank-blank him," said Sir Madok, "an I do not stove-polish

him an I may find him, leave it to me; for never no knight that

hight Ossaise or aught else may do me this disservice and bide

on live, an I may find him, the which I have thereunto sworn a

great oath this day."



And with these words and others, he lightly took his spear and

gat him thence.  In the middle of the afternoon we came upon one

of those very patriarchs ourselves, in the edge of a poor village.

He was basking in the love of relatives and friends whom he had not

seen for fifty years; and about him and caressing him were also

descendants of his own body whom he had never seen at all till now;

but to him these were all strangers, his memory was gone, his mind

was stagnant.  It seemed incredible that a man could outlast half

a century shut up in a dark hole like a rat, but here were his old

wife and some old comrades to testify to it.  They could remember

him as he was in the freshness and strength of his young manhood,

when he kissed his child and delivered it to its mother's hands

and went away into that long oblivion.  The people at the castle

could not tell within half a generation the length of time the man

had been shut up there for his unrecorded and forgotten offense;

but this old wife knew; and so did her old child, who stood there

among her married sons and daughters trying to realize a father

who had been to her a name, a thought, a formless image, a tradition,

all her life, and now was suddenly concreted into actual flesh

and blood and set before her face.



It was a curious situation; yet it is not on that account that

I have made room for it here, but on account of a thing which

seemed to me still more curious.  To wit, that this dreadful matter

brought from these downtrodden people no outburst of rage against

these oppressors.  They had been heritors and subjects of cruelty

and outrage so long that nothing could have startled them but

a kindness.  Yes, here was a curious revelation, indeed, of the

depth to which this people had been sunk in slavery.  Their entire

being was reduced to a monotonous dead level of patience, resignation,

dumb uncomplaining acceptance of whatever might befall them in

this life.  Their very imagination was dead.  When you can say

that of a man, he has struck bottom, I reckon; there is no lower

deep for him.



I rather wished I had gone some other road.  This was not the sort

of experience for a statesman to encounter who was planning out

a peaceful revolution in his mind.  For it could not help bringing

up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing

to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did

achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion:

it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must

_begin_ in blood, whatever may answer afterward.  If history teaches

anything, it teaches that.  What this folk needed, then, was a

Reign of Terror and a guillotine, and I was the wrong man for them.



Two days later, toward noon, Sandy began to show signs of excitement

and feverish expectancy.  She said we were approaching the ogre's

castle.  I was surprised into an uncomfortable shock.  The object

of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden

resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing

for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest.  Sandy's

excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort

of thing is catching.  My heart got to thumping.  You can't reason

with your heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which

the intellect scorns.  Presently, when Sandy slid from the horse,

motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head

bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered

a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker.  And they

kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse

over the declivity; and also while I was creeping to her side on

my knees.  Her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her

finger, and said in a panting whisper:



"The castle!  The castle!  Lo, where it looms!"



What a welcome disappointment I experienced!  I said:



"Castle?  It is nothing but a pigsty; a pigsty with a wattled

fence around it."



She looked surprised and distressed.  The animation faded out of

her face; and during many moments she was lost in thought and

silent.  Then:



"It was not enchanted aforetime," she said in a musing fashion,

as if to herself.  "And how strange is this marvel, and how awful

--that to the one perception it is enchanted and dight in a base

and shameful aspect; yet to the perception of the other it is not

enchanted, hath suffered no change, but stands firm and stately

still, girt with its moat and waving its banners in the blue air

from its towers.  And God shield us, how it pricks the heart to

see again these gracious captives, and the sorrow deepened in their

sweet faces!  We have tarried along, and are to blame."



I saw my cue.  The castle was enchanted to _me_, not to her. It would

be wasted time to try to argue her out of her delusion, it couldn't

be done; I must just humor it.  So I said:



"This is a common case--the enchanting of a thing to one eye and

leaving it in its proper form to another.  You have heard of it

before, Sandy, though you haven't happened to experience it.

But no harm is done.  In fact, it is lucky the way it is.  If these

ladies were hogs to everybody and to themselves, it would be

necessary to break the enchantment, and that might be impossible

if one failed to find out the particular process of the enchantment.

And hazardous, too; for in attempting a disenchantment without the

true key, you are liable to err, and turn your hogs into dogs,

and the dogs into cats, the cats into rats, and so on, and end by

reducing your materials to nothing finally, or to an odorless gas

which you can't follow--which, of course, amounts to the same

thing.  But here, by good luck, no one's eyes but mine are under

the enchantment, and so it is of no consequence to dissolve it.

These ladies remain ladies to you, and to themselves, and to

everybody else; and at the same time they will suffer in no way

from my delusion, for when I know that an ostensible hog is a

lady, that is enough for me, I know how to treat her."



"Thanks, oh, sweet my lord, thou talkest like an angel.  And I know

that thou wilt deliver them, for that thou art minded to great

deeds and art as strong a knight of your hands and as brave to will

and to do, as any that is on live."



"I will not leave a princess in the sty, Sandy.  Are those three

yonder that to my disordered eyes are starveling swine-herds--"



"The ogres, Are _they_ changed also?  It is most wonderful.  Now

am I fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of

their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?  Ah, go warily,

fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than I wend."



"You be easy, Sandy.  All I need to know is, how _much_ of an ogre

is invisible; then I know how to locate his vitals.  Don't you be

afraid, I will make short work of these bunco-steerers.  Stay

where you are."



I left Sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful,

and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the

swine-herds.  I won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs

at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest

quotations.  I was just in time; for the Church, the lord of the

manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along

next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the

swine-herds very short of hogs and Sandy out of princesses.  But

now the tax people could be paid in cash, and there would be

a stake left besides.  One of the men had ten children; and he

said that last year when a priest came and of his ten pigs took

the fattest one for tithes, the wife burst out upon him, and offered

him a child and said:



"Thou beast without bowels of mercy, why leave me my child, yet

rob me of the wherewithal to feed it?"



How curious.  The same thing had happened in the Wales of my day,

under this same old Established Church, which was supposed by many

to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise.



I sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned

Sandy to come--which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush

of a prairie fire.  And when I saw her fling herself upon those

hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them

to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them

reverently by grand princely names, I was ashamed of her, ashamed

of the human race.



We had to drive those hogs home--ten miles; and no ladies were

ever more fickle-minded or contrary.  They would stay in no road,

no path; they broke out through the brush on all sides, and flowed

away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest

places they could find.  And they must not be struck, or roughly

accosted; Sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming

their rank.  The troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called

my Lady, and your Highness, like the rest.  It is annoying and

difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor.  There was one

small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair

on her back, that was the devil for perversity.  She gave me a race

of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where

we had started from, having made not a rod of real progress.

I seized her at last by the tail, and brought her along squealing.

When I overtook Sandy she was horrified, and said it was in the

last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train.



We got the hogs home just at dark--most of them.  The princess

Nerovens de Morganore was missing, and two of her ladies in waiting:

namely, Miss Angela Bohun, and the Demoiselle Elaine Courtemains,

the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star

in her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a

slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side--a couple

of the tryingest blisters to drive that I ever saw.  Also among

the missing were several mere baronesses--and I wanted them to

stay missing; but no, all that sausage-meat had to be found; so

servants were sent out with torches to scour the woods and hills

to that end.



Of course, the whole drove was housed in the house, and, great

guns!--well, I never saw anything like it.  Nor ever heard anything

like it.  And never smelt anything like it.  It was like an

insurrection in a gasometer.







CHAPTER XXI



THE PILGRIMS



When I did get to bed at last I was unspeakably tired; the stretching

out, and the relaxing of the long-tense muscles, how luxurious,

how delicious! but that was as far as I could get--sleep was out of

the question for the present.  The ripping and tearing and squealing

of the nobility up and down the halls and corridors was pandemonium

come again, and kept me broad awake.  Being awake, my thoughts

were busy, of course; and mainly they busied themselves with Sandy's

curious delusion.  Here she was, as sane a person as the kingdom

could produce; and yet, from my point of view she was acting like

a crazy woman.  My land, the power of training! of influence!

of education!  It can bring a body up to believe anything.  I had

to put myself in Sandy's place to realize that she was not a

lunatic.  Yes, and put her in mine, to demonstrate how easy it is

to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have

been taught.  If I had told Sandy I had seen a wagon, uninfluenced

by enchantment, spin along fifty miles an hour; had seen a man,

unequipped with magic powers, get into a basket and soar out of

sight among the clouds; and had listened, without any necromancer's

help, to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles

away, Sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy, she

would have thought she knew it.  Everybody around her believed in

enchantments; nobody had any doubts; to doubt that a castle could

be turned into a sty, and its occupants into hogs, would have been

the same as my doubting among Connecticut people the actuality

of the telephone and its wonders,--and in both cases would be

absolute proof of a diseased mind, an unsettled reason.  Yes, Sandy

was sane; that must be admitted.  If I also would be sane--to Sandy

--I must keep my superstitions about unenchanted and unmiraculous

locomotives, balloons, and telephones, to myself.  Also, I believed

that the world was not flat, and hadn't pillars under it to support

it, nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that

occupied all space above; but as I was the only person in the kingdom

afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions, I recognized

that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter, too,

if I did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody

as a madman.



The next morning Sandy assembled the swine in the dining-room and

gave them their breakfast, waiting upon them personally and

manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of

her island, ancient and modern, have always felt for rank, let its

outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may.

I could have eaten with the hogs if I had had birth approaching my

lofty official rank; but I hadn't, and so accepted the unavoidable

slight and made no complaint.  Sandy and I had our breakfast at

the second table.  The family were not at home.  I said:



"How many are in the family, Sandy, and where do they keep themselves?"



"Family?"



"Yes."



"Which family, good my lord?"



"Why, this family; your own family."



"Sooth to say, I understand you not.  I have no family."



"No family?  Why, Sandy, isn't this your home?"



"Now how indeed might that be?  I have no home."



"Well, then, whose house is this?"



"Ah, wit you well I would tell you an I knew myself."



"Come--you don't even know these people?  Then who invited us here?"



"None invited us.  We but came; that is all."



"Why, woman, this is a most extraordinary performance.  The

effrontery of it is beyond admiration.  We blandly march into

a man's house, and cram it full of the only really valuable nobility

the sun has yet discovered in the earth, and then it turns out

that we don't even know the man's name.  How did you ever venture

to take this extravagant liberty?  I supposed, of course, it was

your home.  What will the man say?"



"What will he say?  Forsooth what can he say but give thanks?"



"Thanks for what?"



Her face was filled with a puzzled surprise:



"Verily, thou troublest mine understanding with strange words.

Do ye dream that one of his estate is like to have the honor twice

in his life to entertain company such as we have brought to grace

his house withal?"



"Well, no--when you come to that.  No, it's an even bet that this

is the first time he has had a treat like this."



"Then let him be thankful, and manifest the same by grateful speech

and due humility; he were a dog, else, and the heir and ancestor

of dogs."



To my mind, the situation was uncomfortable.  It might become more so.

It might be a good idea to muster the hogs and move on.  So I said:



"The day is wasting, Sandy.  It is time to get the nobility together

and be moving."



"Wherefore, fair sir and Boss?"



"We want to take them to their home, don't we?"



"La, but list to him!  They be of all the regions of the earth!

Each must hie to her own home; wend you we might do all these

journeys in one so brief life as He hath appointed that created

life, and thereto death likewise with help of Adam, who by sin

done through persuasion of his helpmeet, she being wrought upon

and bewrayed by the beguilements of the great enemy of man, that

serpent hight Satan, aforetime consecrated and set apart unto that

evil work by overmastering spite and envy begotten in his heart

through fell ambitions that did blight and mildew a nature erst

so white and pure whenso it hove with the shining multitudes

its brethren-born in glade and shade of that fair heaven wherein

all such as native be to that rich estate and--"



"Great Scott!"



"My lord?"



"Well, you know we haven't got time for this sort of thing.  Don't

you see, we could distribute these people around the earth in less

time than it is going to take you to explain that we can't.  We

mustn't talk now, we must act.  You want to be careful; you mustn't

let your mill get the start of you that way, at a time like this.

To business now--and sharp's the word.  Who is to take the

aristocracy home?"



"Even their friends.  These will come for them from the far parts

of the earth."



This was lightning from a clear sky, for unexpectedness; and the

relief of it was like pardon to a prisoner.  She would remain to

deliver the goods, of course.



"Well, then, Sandy, as our enterprise is handsomely and successfully

ended, I will go home and report; and if ever another one--"



"I also am ready; I will go with thee."



This was recalling the pardon.



"How?  You will go with me?  Why should you?"



"Will I be traitor to my knight, dost think?  That were dishonor.

I may not part from thee until in knightly encounter in the field

some overmatching champion shall fairly win and fairly wear me.

I were to blame an I thought that that might ever hap."



"Elected for the long term," I sighed to myself.  "I may as well

make the best of it."  So then I spoke up and said:



"All right; let us make a start."



While she was gone to cry her farewells over the pork, I gave that

whole peerage away to the servants.  And I asked them to take

a duster and dust around a little where the nobilities had mainly

lodged and promenaded; but they considered that that would be

hardly worth while, and would moreover be a rather grave departure

from custom, and therefore likely to make talk.  A departure from

custom--that settled it; it was a nation capable of committing any

crime but that.  The servants said they would follow the fashion,

a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance; they would

scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls, and then the

evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible.

It was a kind of satire on Nature: it was the scientific method,

the geologic method; it deposited the history of the family in

a stratified record; and the antiquary could dig through it and

tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family

had introduced successively for a hundred years.



The first thing we struck that day was a procession of pilgrims.

It was not going our way, but we joined it, nevertheless; for it

was hourly being borne in upon me now, that if I would govern

this country wisely, I must be posted in the details of its life,

and not at second hand, but by personal observation and scrutiny.



This company of pilgrims resembled Chaucer's in this: that it

had in it a sample of about all the upper occupations and professions

the country could show, and a corresponding variety of costume.

There were young men and old men, young women and old women,

lively folk and grave folk.  They rode upon mules and horses, and

there was not a side-saddle in the party; for this specialty was

to remain unknown in England for nine hundred years yet.



It was a pleasant, friendly, sociable herd; pious, happy, merry and

full of unconscious coarsenesses and innocent indecencies.  What

they regarded as the merry tale went the continual round and caused

no more embarrassment than it would have caused in the best English

society twelve centuries later.  Practical jokes worthy of the

English wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century

were sprung here and there and yonder along the line, and compelled

the delightedest applause; and sometimes when a bright remark was

made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward

the other, you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling

spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along;

and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake.



Sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage, and she posted

me.  She said:



"They journey to the Valley of Holiness, for to be blessed of the

godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed

from sin."



"Where is this watering place?"



"It lieth a two-day journey hence, by the borders of the land that

hight the Cuckoo Kingdom."



"Tell me about it.  Is it a celebrated place?"



"Oh, of a truth, yes.  There be none more so.  Of old time there

lived there an abbot and his monks.  Belike were none in the world

more holy than these; for they gave themselves to study of pious

books, and spoke not the one to the other, or indeed to any, and

ate decayed herbs and naught thereto, and slept hard, and prayed

much, and washed never; also they wore the same garment until it

fell from their bodies through age and decay.  Right so came they

to be known of all the world by reason of these holy austerities,

and visited by rich and poor, and reverenced."



"Proceed."



"But always there was lack of water there.  Whereas, upon a time,

the holy abbot prayed, and for answer a great stream of clear

water burst forth by miracle in a desert place.  Now were the

fickle monks tempted of the Fiend, and they wrought with their

abbot unceasingly by beggings and beseechings that he would construct

a bath; and when he was become aweary and might not resist more,

he said have ye your will, then, and granted that they asked.

Now mark thou what 'tis to forsake the ways of purity the which

He loveth, and wanton with such as be worldly and an offense.

These monks did enter into the bath and come thence washed as

white as snow; and lo, in that moment His sign appeared, in

miraculous rebuke! for His insulted waters ceased to flow, and

utterly vanished away."



"They fared mildly, Sandy, considering how that kind of crime

is regarded in this country."



"Belike; but it was their first sin; and they had been of perfect

life for long, and differing in naught from the angels.  Prayers,

tears, torturings of the flesh, all was vain to beguile that water

to flow again.  Even processions; even burnt-offerings; even votive

candles to the Virgin, did fail every each of them; and all in

the land did marvel."



"How odd to find that even this industry has its financial panics,

and at times sees its assignats and greenbacks languish to zero,

and everything come to a standstill.  Go on, Sandy."



"And so upon a time, after year and day, the good abbot made humble

surrender and destroyed the bath.  And behold, His anger was in that

moment appeased, and the waters gushed richly forth again, and even

unto this day they have not ceased to flow in that generous measure."



"Then I take it nobody has washed since."



"He that would essay it could have his halter free; yes, and

swiftly would he need it, too."



"The community has prospered since?"



"Even from that very day.  The fame of the miracle went abroad

into all lands.  From every land came monks to join; they came

even as the fishes come, in shoals; and the monastery added building

to building, and yet others to these, and so spread wide its arms

and took them in.  And nuns came, also; and more again, and yet

more; and built over against the monastery on the yon side of the

vale, and added building to building, until mighty was that nunnery.

And these were friendly unto those, and they joined their loving

labors together, and together they built a fair great foundling

asylum midway of the valley between."



"You spoke of some hermits, Sandy."



"These have gathered there from the ends of the earth.  A hermit

thriveth best where there be multitudes of pilgrims.  Ye shall not

find no hermit of no sort wanting.  If any shall mention a hermit

of a kind he thinketh new and not to be found but in some far

strange land, let him but scratch among the holes and caves and

swamps that line that Valley of Holiness, and whatsoever be his

breed, it skills not, he shall find a sample of it there."



I closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored

face, purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further

crumbs of fact; but I had hardly more than scraped acquaintance

with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up, in the

immemorial way, to that same old anecdote--the one Sir Dinadan

told me, what time I got into trouble with Sir Sagramor and was

challenged of him on account of it.  I excused myself and dropped

to the rear of the procession, sad at heart, willing to go hence

from this troubled life, this vale of tears, this brief day of

broken rest, of cloud and storm, of weary struggle and monotonous

defeat; and yet shrinking from the change, as remembering how long

eternity is, and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote.



Early in the afternoon we overtook another procession of pilgrims;

but in this one was no merriment, no jokes, no laughter, no playful

ways, nor any happy giddiness, whether of youth or age.  Yet both

were here, both age and youth; gray old men and women, strong men

and women of middle age, young husbands, young wives, little boys

and girls, and three babies at the breast.  Even the children were

smileless; there was not a face among all these half a hundred

people but was cast down, and bore that set expression of hopelessness

which is bred of long and hard trials and old acquaintance with

despair.  They were slaves.  Chains led from their fettered feet

and their manacled hands to a sole-leather belt about their waists;

and all except the children were also linked together in a file

six feet apart, by a single chain which led from collar to collar

all down the line.  They were on foot, and had tramped three

hundred miles in eighteen days, upon the cheapest odds and ends

of food, and stingy rations of that.  They had slept in these

chains every night, bundled together like swine.  They had upon

their bodies some poor rags, but they could not be said to be

clothed.  Their irons had chafed the skin from their ankles and

made sores which were ulcerated and wormy.  Their naked feet were

torn, and none walked without a limp.  Originally there had been a

hundred of these unfortunates, but about half had been sold on

the trip.  The trader in charge of them rode a horse and carried

a whip with a short handle and a long heavy lash divided into

several knotted tails at the end.  With this whip he cut the

shoulders of any that tottered from weariness and pain, and

straightened them up.  He did not speak; the whip conveyed his

desire without that.  None of these poor creatures looked up as

we rode along by; they showed no consciousness of our presence.

And they made no sound but one; that was the dull and awful clank

of their chains from end to end of the long file, as forty-three

burdened feet rose and fell in unison.  The file moved in a cloud

of its own making.



All these faces were gray with a coating of dust.  One has seen

the like of this coating upon furniture in unoccupied houses, and

has written his idle thought in it with his finger.  I was reminded

of this when I noticed the faces of some of those women, young

mothers carrying babes that were near to death and freedom, how

a something in their hearts was written in the dust upon their

faces, plain to see, and lord, how plain to read! for it was the

track of tears.  One of these young mothers was but a girl, and

it hurt me to the heart to read that writing, and reflect that it

was come up out of the breast of such a child, a breast that ought

not to know trouble yet, but only the gladness of the morning of

life; and no doubt--



She reeled just then, giddy with fatigue, and down came the lash

and flicked a flake of skin from her naked shoulder.  It stung me

as if I had been hit instead.  The master halted the file and

jumped from his horse.  He stormed and swore at this girl, and

said she had made annoyance enough with her laziness, and as this

was the last chance he should have, he would settle the account now.

She dropped on her knees and put up her hands and began to beg,

and cry, and implore, in a passion of terror, but the master gave

no attention.  He snatched the child from her, and then made the

men-slaves who were chained before and behind her throw her on

the ground and hold her there and expose her body; and then he

laid on with his lash like a madman till her back was flayed, she

shrieking and struggling the while piteously.  One of the men who

was holding her turned away his face, and for this humanity he was

reviled and flogged.



All our pilgrims looked on and commented--on the expert way in

which the whip was handled.  They were too much hardened by lifelong

everyday familiarity with slavery to notice that there was anything

else in the exhibition that invited comment.  This was what slavery

could do, in the way of ossifying what one may call the superior

lobe of human feeling; for these pilgrims were kind-hearted people,

and they would not have allowed that man to treat a horse like that.



I wanted to stop the whole thing and set the slaves free, but that

would not do.  I must not interfere too much and get myself a name

for riding over the country's laws and the citizen's rights

roughshod.  If I lived and prospered I would be the death of

slavery, that I was resolved upon; but I would try to fix it so

that when I became its executioner it should be by command of

the nation.



Just here was the wayside shop of a smith; and now arrived a landed

proprietor who had bought this girl a few miles back, deliverable

here where her irons could be taken off.  They were removed; then

there was a squabble between the gentleman and the dealer as to

which should pay the blacksmith.  The moment the girl was delivered

from her irons, she flung herself, all tears and frantic sobbings,

into the arms of the slave who had turned away his face when she

was whipped.  He strained her to his breast, and smothered her

face and the child's with kisses, and washed them with the rain

of his tears.  I suspected.  I inquired.  Yes, I was right; it was

husband and wife.  They had to be torn apart by force; the girl

had to be dragged away, and she struggled and fought and shrieked

like one gone mad till a turn of the road hid her from sight; and

even after that, we could still make out the fading plaint of those

receding shrieks.  And the husband and father, with his wife and

child gone, never to be seen by him again in life?--well, the look

of him one might not bear at all, and so I turned away; but I knew

I should never get his picture out of my mind again, and there

it is to this day, to wring my heartstrings whenever I think of it.



We put up at the inn in a village just at nightfall, and when

I rose next morning and looked abroad, I was ware where a knight

came riding in the golden glory of the new day, and recognized him

for knight of mine--Sir Ozana le Cure Hardy.  He was in the

gentlemen's furnishing line, and his missionarying specialty was

plug hats.  He was clothed all in steel, in the beautifulest armor

of the time--up to where his helmet ought to have been; but he

hadn't any helmet, he wore a shiny stove-pipe hat, and was ridiculous

a spectacle as one might want to see.  It was another of my

surreptitious schemes for extinguishing knighthood by making it

grotesque and absurd.  Sir Ozana's saddle was hung about with

leather hat boxes, and every time he overcame a wandering knight

he swore him into my service and fitted him with a plug and made

him wear it.  I dressed and ran down to welcome Sir Ozana and

get his news.



"How is trade?" I asked.



"Ye will note that I have but these four left; yet were they sixteen

whenas I got me from Camelot."



"Why, you have certainly done nobly, Sir Ozana.  Where have you

been foraging of late?"



"I am but now come from the Valley of Holiness, please you sir."



"I am pointed for that place myself.  Is there anything stirring

in the monkery, more than common?"



"By the mass ye may not question it!....  Give him good feed,

boy, and stint it not, an thou valuest thy crown; so get ye lightly

to the stable and do even as I bid....  Sir, it is parlous news

I bring, and--be these pilgrims?  Then ye may not do better, good

folk, than gather and hear the tale I have to tell, sith it

concerneth you, forasmuch as ye go to find that ye will not find,

and seek that ye will seek in vain, my life being hostage for my

word, and my word and message being these, namely: That a hap

has happened whereof the like has not been seen no more but once

this two hundred years, which was the first and last time that

that said misfortune strake the holy valley in that form by

commandment of the Most High whereto by reasons just and causes

thereunto contributing, wherein the matter--"



"The miraculous fount hath ceased to flow!"  This shout burst from

twenty pilgrim mouths at once.



"Ye say well, good people.  I was verging to it, even when ye spake."



"Has somebody been washing again?"



"Nay, it is suspected, but none believe it.  It is thought to be

some other sin, but none wit what."



"How are they feeling about the calamity?"



"None may describe it in words.  The fount is these nine days dry.

The prayers that did begin then, and the lamentations in sackcloth

and ashes, and the holy processions, none of these have ceased

nor night nor day; and so the monks and the nuns and the foundlings

be all exhausted, and do hang up prayers writ upon parchment,

sith that no strength is left in man to lift up voice.  And at last

they sent for thee, Sir Boss, to try magic and enchantment; and

if you could not come, then was the messenger to fetch Merlin,

and he is there these three days now, and saith he will fetch that

water though he burst the globe and wreck its kingdoms to accomplish

it; and right bravely doth he work his magic and call upon his

hellions to hie them hither and help, but not a whiff of moisture

hath he started yet, even so much as might qualify as mist upon

a copper mirror an ye count not the barrel of sweat he sweateth

betwixt sun and sun over the dire labors of his task; and if ye--"



Breakfast was ready.  As soon as it was over I showed to Sir Ozana

these words which I had written on the inside of his hat: "Chemical

Department, Laboratory extension, Section G. Pxxp.  Send two of

first size, two of No. 3, and six of No. 4, together with the proper

complementary details--and two of my trained assistants."  And I said:



"Now get you to Camelot as fast as you can fly, brave knight, and

show the writing to Clarence, and tell him to have these required

matters in the Valley of Holiness with all possible dispatch."



"I will well, Sir Boss," and he was off.







CHAPTER XXII



THE HOLY FOUNTAIN



The pilgrims were human beings.  Otherwise they would have acted

differently.  They had come a long and difficult journey, and now

when the journey was nearly finished, and they learned that the main

thing they had come for had ceased to exist, they didn't do as

horses or cats or angle-worms would probably have done--turn back

and get at something profitable--no, anxious as they had before

been to see the miraculous fountain, they were as much as forty

times as anxious now to see the place where it had used to be.

There is no accounting for human beings.



We made good time; and a couple of hours before sunset we stood

upon the high confines of the Valley of Holiness, and our eyes

swept it from end to end and noted its features.  That is, its

large features.  These were the three masses of buildings.  They

were distant and isolated temporalities shrunken to toy constructions

in the lonely waste of what seemed a desert--and was.  Such a scene

is always mournful, it is so impressively still, and looks so

steeped in death.  But there was a sound here which interrupted

the stillness only to add to its mournfulness; this was the faint

far sound of tolling bells which floated fitfully to us on the

passing breeze, and so faintly, so softly, that we hardly knew

whether we heard it with our ears or with our spirits.



We reached the monastery before dark, and there the males were

given lodging, but the women were sent over to the nunnery.  The

bells were close at hand now, and their solemn booming smote

upon the ear like a message of doom.  A superstitious despair

possessed the heart of every monk and published itself in his

ghastly face.  Everywhere, these black-robed, soft-sandaled,

tallow-visaged specters appeared, flitted about and disappeared,

noiseless as the creatures of a troubled dream, and as uncanny.



The old abbot's joy to see me was pathetic.  Even to tears; but

he did the shedding himself.  He said:



"Delay not, son, but get to thy saving work.  An we bring not

the water back again, and soon, we are ruined, and the good work

of two hundred years must end.  And see thou do it with enchantments

that be holy, for the Church will not endure that work in her cause

be done by devil's magic."



"When I work, Father, be sure there will be no devil's work

connected with it.  I shall use no arts that come of the devil,

and no elements not created by the hand of God.  But is Merlin

working strictly on pious lines?"



"Ah, he said he would, my son, he said he would, and took oath

to make his promise good."



"Well, in that case, let him proceed."



"But surely you will not sit idle by, but help?"



"It will not answer to mix methods, Father; neither would it be

professional courtesy.  Two of a trade must not underbid each

other.  We might as well cut rates and be done with it; it would

arrive at that in the end.  Merlin has the contract; no other

magician can touch it till he throws it up."



"But I will take it from him; it is a terrible emergency and the

act is thereby justified.  And if it were not so, who will give

law to the Church?  The Church giveth law to all; and what she

wills to do, that she may do, hurt whom it may.  I will take it

from him; you shall begin upon the moment."



"It may not be, Father.  No doubt, as you say, where power is

supreme, one can do as one likes and suffer no injury; but we poor

magicians are not so situated.  Merlin is a very good magician

in a small way, and has quite a neat provincial reputation.  He

is struggling along, doing the best he can, and it would not be

etiquette for me to take his job until he himself abandons it."



The abbot's face lighted.



"Ah, that is simple.  There are ways to persuade him to abandon it."



"No-no, Father, it skills not, as these people say.  If he were

persuaded against his will, he would load that well with a malicious

enchantment which would balk me until I found out its secret.

It might take a month.  I could set up a little enchantment of

mine which I call the telephone, and he could not find out its

secret in a hundred years.  Yes, you perceive, he might block me

for a month.  Would you like to risk a month in a dry time like this?"



"A month!  The mere thought of it maketh me to shudder.  Have it

thy way, my son.  But my heart is heavy with this disappointment.

Leave me, and let me wear my spirit with weariness and waiting,

even as I have done these ten long days, counterfeiting thus

the thing that is called rest, the prone body making outward sign

of repose where inwardly is none."



Of course, it would have been best, all round, for Merlin to waive

etiquette and quit and call it half a day, since he would never be

able to start that water, for he was a true magician of the time;

which is to say, the big miracles, the ones that gave him his

reputation, always had the luck to be performed when nobody but

Merlin was present; he couldn't start this well with all this crowd

around to see; a crowd was as bad for a magician's miracle in

that day as it was for a spiritualist's miracle in mine; there was

sure to be some skeptic on hand to turn up the gas at the crucial

moment and spoil everything.  But I did not want Merlin to retire

from the job until I was ready to take hold of it effectively

myself; and I could not do that until I got my things from Camelot,

and that would take two or three days.



My presence gave the monks hope, and cheered them up a good deal;

insomuch that they ate a square meal that night for the first time

in ten days.  As soon as their stomachs had been properly reinforced

with food, their spirits began to rise fast; when the mead began to

go round they rose faster.  By the time everybody was half-seas over,

the holy community was in good shape to make a night of it; so we

stayed by the board and put it through on that line.  Matters got

to be very jolly.  Good old questionable stories were told that made

the tears run down and cavernous mouths stand wide and the round

bellies shake with laughter; and questionable songs were bellowed out

in a mighty chorus that drowned the boom of the tolling bells.



At last I ventured a story myself; and vast was the success of it.

Not right off, of course, for the native of those islands does

not, as a rule, dissolve upon the early applications of a humorous

thing; but the fifth time I told it, they began to crack in places;

the eight time I told it, they began to crumble; at the twelfth

repetition they fell apart in chunks; and at the fifteenth they

disintegrated, and I got a broom and swept them up.  This language

is figurative.  Those islanders--well, they are slow pay at first,

in the matter of return for your investment of effort, but in the end

they make the pay of all other nations poor and small by contrast.



I was at the well next day betimes.  Merlin was there, enchanting

away like a beaver, but not raising the moisture.  He was not in

a pleasant humor; and every time I hinted that perhaps this contract

was a shade too hefty for a novice he unlimbered his tongue and

cursed like a bishop--French bishop of the Regency days, I mean.



Matters were about as I expected to find them.  The "fountain" was

an ordinary well, it had been dug in the ordinary way, and stoned up

in the ordinary way.  There was no miracle about it.  Even the lie

that had created its reputation was not miraculous; I could have

told it myself, with one hand tied behind me.  The well was in a

dark chamber which stood in the center of a cut-stone chapel, whose

walls were hung with pious pictures of a workmanship that would

have made a chromo feel good; pictures historically commemorative

of curative miracles which had been achieved by the waters when

nobody was looking.  That is, nobody but angels; they are always

on deck when there is a miracle to the fore--so as to get put in

the picture, perhaps.  Angels are as fond of that as a fire company;

look at the old masters.



The well-chamber was dimly lighted by lamps; the water was drawn

with a windlass and chain by monks, and poured into troughs which

delivered it into stone reservoirs outside in the chapel--when

there was water to draw, I mean--and none but monks could enter

the well-chamber.  I entered it, for I had temporary authority

to do so, by courtesy of my professional brother and subordinate.

But he hadn't entered it himself.  He did everything by incantations;

he never worked his intellect.  If he had stepped in there and used

his eyes, instead of his disordered mind, he could have cured

the well by natural means, and then turned it into a miracle in

the customary way; but no, he was an old numskull, a magician who

believed in his own magic; and no magician can thrive who is

handicapped with a superstition like that.



I had an idea that the well had sprung a leak; that some of the

wall stones near the bottom had fallen and exposed fissures that

allowed the water to escape.  I measured the chain--98 feet.  Then

I called in a couple of monks, locked the door, took a candle, and

made them lower me in the bucket.  When the chain was all paid out,

the candle confirmed my suspicion; a considerable section of the

wall was gone, exposing a good big fissure.



I almost regretted that my theory about the well's trouble was

correct, because I had another one that had a showy point or two

about it for a miracle.  I remembered that in America, many

centuries later, when an oil well ceased to flow, they used to

blast it out with a dynamite torpedo.  If I should find this well

dry and no explanation of it, I could astonish these people most

nobly by having a person of no especial value drop a dynamite

bomb into it.  It was my idea to appoint Merlin.  However, it was

plain that there was no occasion for the bomb.  One cannot have

everything the way he would like it.  A man has no business to

be depressed by a disappointment, anyway; he ought to make up his

mind to get even.  That is what I did.  I said to myself, I am in no

hurry, I can wait; that bomb will come good yet.  And it did, too.



When I was above ground again, I turned out the monks, and let down

a fish-line; the well was a hundred and fifty feet deep, and there

was forty-one feet of water in it.  I called in a monk and asked:



"How deep is the well?"



"That, sir, I wit not, having never been told."



"How does the water usually stand in it?"



"Near to the top, these two centuries, as the testimony goeth,

brought down to us through our predecessors."



It was true--as to recent times at least--for there was witness

to it, and better witness than a monk; only about twenty or thirty

feet of the chain showed wear and use, the rest of it was unworn

and rusty.  What had happened when the well gave out that other

time?  Without doubt some practical person had come along and

mended the leak, and then had come up and told the abbot he had

discovered by divination that if the sinful bath were destroyed

the well would flow again.  The leak had befallen again now, and

these children would have prayed, and processioned, and tolled

their bells for heavenly succor till they all dried up and blew

away, and no innocent of them all would ever have thought to drop

a fish-line into the well or go down in it and find out what was

really the matter.  Old habit of mind is one of the toughest things

to get away from in the world.  It transmits itself like physical

form and feature; and for a man, in those days, to have had an idea

that his ancestors hadn't had, would have brought him under suspicion

of being illegitimate.  I said to the monk:



"It is a difficult miracle to restore water in a dry well, but we

will try, if my brother Merlin fails.  Brother Merlin is a very

passable artist, but only in the parlor-magic line, and he may

not succeed; in fact, is not likely to succeed.  But that should

be nothing to his discredit; the man that can do _this_ kind of

miracle knows enough to keep hotel."



"Hotel?  I mind not to have heard--"



"Of hotel?  It's what you call hostel.  The man that can do this

miracle can keep hostel.  I can do this miracle; I shall do this

miracle; yet I do not try to conceal from you that it is a miracle

to tax the occult powers to the last strain."



"None knoweth that truth better than the brotherhood, indeed; for

it is of record that aforetime it was parlous difficult and took

a year.  Natheless, God send you good success, and to that end

will we pray."



As a matter of business it was a good idea to get the notion around

that the thing was difficult.  Many a small thing has been made

large by the right kind of advertising.  That monk was filled up

with the difficulty of this enterprise; he would fill up the others.

In two days the solicitude would be booming.



On my way home at noon, I met Sandy.  She had been sampling the

hermits.  I said:



"I would like to do that myself.  This is Wednesday.  Is there

a matinee?"



"A which, please you, sir?"



"Matinee.  Do they keep open afternoons?"



"Who?"



"The hermits, of course."



"Keep open?"



"Yes, keep open.  Isn't that plain enough?  Do they knock off at noon?"



"Knock off?"



"Knock off?--yes, knock off.  What is the matter with knock off?

I never saw such a dunderhead; can't you understand anything at all?

In plain terms, do they shut up shop, draw the game, bank the fires--"



"Shut up shop, draw--"



"There, never mind, let it go; you make me tired.  You can't seem

to understand the simplest thing."



"I would I might please thee, sir, and it is to me dole and sorrow

that I fail, albeit sith I am but a simple damsel and taught of

none, being from the cradle unbaptized in those deep waters of

learning that do anoint with a sovereignty him that partaketh of

that most noble sacrament, investing him with reverend state to

the mental eye of the humble mortal who, by bar and lack of that

great consecration seeth in his own unlearned estate but a symbol

of that other sort of lack and loss which men do publish to the

pitying eye with sackcloth trappings whereon the ashes of grief

do lie bepowdered and bestrewn, and so, when such shall in the

darkness of his mind encounter these golden phrases of high mystery,

these shut-up-shops, and draw-the-game, and bank-the-fires, it is

but by the grace of God that he burst not for envy of the mind that

can beget, and tongue that can deliver so great and mellow-sounding

miracles of speech, and if there do ensue confusion in that humbler

mind, and failure to divine the meanings of these wonders, then

if so be this miscomprehension is not vain but sooth and true,

wit ye well it is the very substance of worshipful dear homage and

may not lightly be misprized, nor had been, an ye had noted this

complexion of mood and mind and understood that that I would

I could not, and that I could not I might not, nor yet nor might

_nor_ could, nor might-not nor could-not, might be by advantage

turned to the desired _would_, and so I pray you mercy of my fault,

and that ye will of your kindness and your charity forgive it, good

my master and most dear lord."



I couldn't make it all out--that is, the details--but I got the

general idea; and enough of it, too, to be ashamed.  It was not

fair to spring those nineteenth century technicalities upon the

untutored infant of the sixth and then rail at her because she

couldn't get their drift; and when she was making the honest best

drive at it she could, too, and no fault of hers that she couldn't

fetch the home plate; and so I apologized.  Then we meandered

pleasantly away toward the hermit holes in sociable converse

together, and better friends than ever.



I was gradually coming to have a mysterious and shuddery reverence

for this girl; nowadays whenever she pulled out from the station

and got her train fairly started on one of those horizonless

transcontinental sentences of hers, it was borne in upon me that

I was standing in the awful presence of the Mother of the German

Language.  I was so impressed with this, that sometimes when she

began to empty one of these sentences on me I unconsciously took

the very attitude of reverence, and stood uncovered; and if words

had been water, I had been drowned, sure.  She had exactly the

German way; whatever was in her mind to be delivered, whether a

mere remark, or a sermon, or a cyclopedia, or the history of a war,

she would get it into a single sentence or die.  Whenever the literary

German dives into a sentence, that is the last you are going to see

of him till he emerges on the other side of his Atlantic with his

verb in his mouth.



We drifted from hermit to hermit all the afternoon.  It was a most

strange menagerie.  The chief emulation among them seemed to be,

to see which could manage to be the uncleanest and most prosperous

with vermin.  Their manner and attitudes were the last expression

of complacent self-righteousness.  It was one anchorite's pride

to lie naked in the mud and let the insects bite him and blister

him unmolested; it was another's to lean against a rock, all day

long, conspicuous to the admiration of the throng of pilgrims

and pray; it was another's to go naked and crawl around on all fours;

it was another's to drag about with him, year in and year out,

eighty pounds of iron; it was another's to never lie down when

he slept, but to stand among the thorn-bushes and snore when there

were pilgrims around to look; a woman, who had the white hair of

age, and no other apparel, was black from crown to heel with

forty-seven years of holy abstinence from water.  Groups of gazing

pilgrims stood around all and every of these strange objects, lost

in reverent wonder, and envious of the fleckless sanctity which

these pious austerities had won for them from an exacting heaven.



By and by we went to see one of the supremely great ones.  He was

a mighty celebrity; his fame had penetrated all Christendom; the

noble and the renowned journeyed from the remotest lands on the globe

to pay him reverence.  His stand was in the center of the widest part

of the valley; and it took all that space to hold his crowds.



His stand was a pillar sixty feet high, with a broad platform on

the top of it.  He was now doing what he had been doing every day

for twenty years up there--bowing his body ceaselessly and rapidly

almost to his feet.  It was his way of praying.  I timed him with a

stop watch, and he made 1,244 revolutions in 24 minutes and

46 seconds.  It seemed a pity to have all this power going to waste.

It was one of the most useful motions in mechanics, the pedal

movement; so I made a note in my memorandum book, purposing some

day to apply a system of elastic cords to him and run a sewing

machine with it.  I afterward carried out that scheme, and got

five years' good service out of him; in which time he turned out

upward of eighteen thousand first-rate tow-linen shirts, which

was ten a day.  I worked him Sundays and all; he was going, Sundays,

the same as week days, and it was no use to waste the power.

These shirts cost me nothing but just the mere trifle for the

materials--I furnished those myself, it would not have been right

to make him do that--and they sold like smoke to pilgrims at a

dollar and a half apiece, which was the price of fifty cows or

a blooded race horse in Arthurdom.  They were regarded as a perfect

protection against sin, and advertised as such by my knights

everywhere, with the paint-pot and stencil-plate; insomuch that

there was not a cliff or a bowlder or a dead wall in England but

you could read on it at a mile distance:



"Buy the only genuine St. Stylite; patronized by the Nobility.

Patent applied for."



There was more money in the business than one knew what to do with.

As it extended, I brought out a line of goods suitable for kings,

and a nobby thing for duchesses and that sort, with ruffles down

the forehatch and the running-gear clewed up with a featherstitch

to leeward and then hauled aft with a back-stay and triced up with

a half-turn in the standing rigging forward of the weather-gaskets.

Yes, it was a daisy.



But about that time I noticed that the motive power had taken to

standing on one leg, and I found that there was something the matter

with the other one; so I stocked the business and unloaded, taking

Sir Bors de Ganis into camp financially along with certain of his

friends; for the works stopped within a year, and the good saint

got him to his rest.  But he had earned it.  I can say that for him.



When I saw him that first time--however, his personal condition

will not quite bear description here.  You can read it in the

Lives of the Saints.*

CHAPTER XXIII



RESTORATION OF THE FOUNTAIN



Saturday noon I went to the well and looked on a while.  Merlin

was still burning smoke-powders, and pawing the air, and muttering

gibberish as hard as ever, but looking pretty down-hearted, for

of course he had not started even a perspiration in that well yet.

Finally I said:



"How does the thing promise by this time, partner?"



"Behold, I am even now busied with trial of the powerfulest

enchantment known to the princes of the occult arts in the lands

of the East; an it fail me, naught can avail.  Peace, until I finish."



He raised a smoke this time that darkened all the region, and must

have made matters uncomfortable for the hermits, for the wind

was their way, and it rolled down over their dens in a dense and

billowy fog.  He poured out volumes of speech to match, and contorted

his body and sawed the air with his hands in a most extraordinary

way.  At the end of twenty minutes he dropped down panting, and

about exhausted.  Now arrived the abbot and several hundred monks

and nuns, and behind them a multitude of pilgrims and a couple of

acres of foundlings, all drawn by the prodigious smoke, and all

in a grand state of excitement.  The abbot inquired anxiously for

results.  Merlin said:



"If any labor of mortal might break the spell that binds these

waters, this which I have but just essayed had done it.  It has

failed; whereby I do now know that that which I had feared is

a truth established; the sign of this failure is, that the most

potent spirit known to the magicians of the East, and whose name

none may utter and live, has laid his spell upon this well.  The

mortal does not breathe, nor ever will, who can penetrate the secret

of that spell, and without that secret none can break it.  The

water will flow no more forever, good Father.  I have done what

man could.  Suffer me to go."



Of course this threw the abbot into a good deal of a consternation.

He turned to me with the signs of it in his face, and said:



"Ye have heard him. Is it true?"



"Part of it is."



"Not all, then, not all!  What part is true?"



"That that spirit with the Russian name has put his spell

upon the well."



"God's wounds, then are we ruined!"



"Possibly."



"But not certainly?  Ye mean, not certainly?"



"That is it."



"Wherefore, ye also mean that when he saith none can break the spell--"



"Yes, when he says that, he says what isn't necessarily true.

There are conditions under which an effort to break it may have

some chance--that is, some small, some trifling chance--of success."



"The conditions--"



"Oh, they are nothing difficult.  Only these: I want the well

and the surroundings for the space of half a mile, entirely to

myself from sunset to-day until I remove the ban--and nobody

allowed to cross the ground but by my authority."



"Are these all?"



"Yes."



"And you have no fear to try?"



"Oh, none.  One may fail, of course; and one may also succeed.

One can try, and I am ready to chance it.  I have my conditions?"



"These and all others ye may name.  I will issue commandment

to that effect."



"Wait," said Merlin, with an evil smile.  "Ye wit that he that

would break this spell must know that spirit's name?"



"Yes, I know his name."



"And wit you also that to know it skills not of itself, but ye
